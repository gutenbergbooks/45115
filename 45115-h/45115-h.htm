<h2>NEW METHOD OF ESTIMATING THE AGE OF NIAGARA FALLS.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By G. FREDERICK WRIGHT.</span></p>


<p>Both the interest and the importance of the subject make it
worth while to follow out every clew that may lead to the approximate
determination of the age of Niagara Falls. During this
past season, in connection with some work done for the New York
Central Railroad upon their branch line which runs along the eastern
face of the gorge from Bloody Run to Lewiston, I fortunately came
into possession of data from which an estimate of the age of the falls
can be made entirely independent of those which have heretofore
been current. The bearing and importance of the new data can best
be seen after a brief <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the efforts heretofore made to solve
this important problem.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illo_006_fig1.jpg" width="600" height="473" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;Looking north from below the Whirlpool, showing the electric road at the bottom
of the east side of the gorge, and the steam road descending the face about halfway to
the top.</span>
</div>

<p>In 1841 Sir Charles Lyell and the late Prof. James Hall visited
the falls together; but, having no means of determining the rate
of recession, except from the indefinite reports of residents and guides,
they could place no great confidence in the "guess," made by Sir
Charles Lyell, that it could not be more than one foot a year. As
the length of the gorge from Lewiston up is about seven miles, the
time required for its erosion at this rate would be thirty-five thousand
years. The great authority and popularity of Lyell led the general
public to put more confidence in this estimate than the distinguished
authors themselves did. Mr. Bakewell, another eminent English
geologist, at about the same time estimated the rate of the recession
as threefold greater than Lyell and Hall had done, which would reduce
the time to about eleven thousand years.</p>

<p>But, to prepare the way for a more definite settlement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
question, the New York Geological Survey, under Professor Hall's
direction, had a careful trigonometric survey of the Horseshoe Fall
made in 1842, erecting monuments at the points at which their angles
were taken, so that, after a sufficient lapse of time, the actual rate
of recession could be more accurately determined. In 1886 Mr.
Woodward, of the United States Geological Survey, made a new
survey, and found that the actual amount of recession in the center
of the Horseshoe Fall had proceeded at an average rate of about five
feet per annum. The subject was thoroughly discussed by Drs.
Pohlman and Gilbert, at the Buffalo meeting of the American Association
in 1886, when it was proved, to the satisfaction of every one,
that, if the supply of water had been constant throughout its history,
the whole work of eroding the gorge from Lewiston to the Falls
would have been accomplished, at the present rate of recession, in
about seven thousand years.</p>

<p>But the question was immediately raised, Has the supply of water
in Niagara River been constant? It was my privilege, in the autumn
of 1892 (see Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, vol. iv,
pp. 421-427), to bring forth the first positive evidence that the water
pouring over Niagara had for a time been diverted, having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
turned through Lake Nipissing down the valley of the Mattawa into
the Ottawa River, following nearly the line of Champlain's old trail
and of the present Canadian Pacific Railroad. The correctness of
this inference has been abundantly confirmed by subsequent investigations
of Mr. F. B. Taylor and Dr. Robert Bell.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> The occasion
of this diversion of the drainage of the Great Lakes from the Niagara
through the Ottawa Valley was the well-known northerly subsidence
of the land in Canada at the close of the Glacial period. When the
ice melted off from the lower part of the Ottawa Valley the land
stood five hundred feet lower than it does now, but the extent of this
subsidence diminished both to the south and the west, making it
difficult to estimate just how great it was at the Nipissing outlet. A
subsidence of one hundred feet at that point, however, would now
divert the waters into the Ottawa River. That it actually was so
diverted is shown both by converging high-level shore lines at the
head of the Mattawa Valley and by the immense delta deposits at
its junction with the Ottawa, to which attention was first called in
my paper referred to above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>The indeterminate question which remained was, At what rate
did this postglacial elevation of land which has brought it up to
its present level proceed? Dr. Gilbert, Professor Spencer, and Mr.
Taylor have brought forth a variety of facts which, according to
their interpretation, show that this rate of elevation was so slow that
from twenty thousand to thirty thousand years was required to restore
to the Niagara River its present volume of water. Their arguments
are based upon the varying width and depth of the Niagara gorge,
proving, as they think, the presence of a smaller amount of water
during the erosion of some portions. Dr. Gilbert has also brought
forward some facts concerning the extent of supposed erosion produced
by the diverted waters of Niagara when passing over an
intermediate outlet between Lake Simcoe and Lake Nipissing. But
the difficulty of obtaining any safe basis for calculation upon these
speculative considerations has increased the desire to find a means of
calculation which should be independent of the indeterminate problems
involved. That I think I have found, and so have made a
beginning in obtaining desired results. <i>The new evidence lies in
the extent of the enlargement of the mouth of the Niagara gorge at
Lewiston since the recession of the falls began.</i></p>

<p>It is evident that the oldest part of the Niagara gorge is at its
mouth, at Lewiston, where the escarpment suddenly breaks down to
the level of Lake Ontario. The walls of the gorge rise here to a
height of three hundred and forty feet above the level of the river.
It is clear that from the moment the recession of the falls began at
Lewiston the walls of the gorge on either side have been subject to
the action of constant disintegrating agencies, tending to enlarge
the mouth and make it V-shaped. What I did last summer was to
measure the exact amount of this enlargement, and to obtain an approximate
estimate of the rate at which it is going on.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> As this enlargement
proceeds wholly through the action of atmospheric agencies,
the conditions are constant, and it is hoped that sufficiently
definite results have been obtained to set some limits to the speculations
which have been made upon more indefinite grounds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;View looking east across the gorge near the mouth, showing the railroads and the
outcrops of Clinton and Niagara limestones above the steam road.</span>
</div>

<p>The face on the east side of the gorge presents a series of alternate
layers of hard and soft rocks, of which certain portions are very susceptible
to the disintegrating agencies of the atmosphere. The summit
consists of from twenty to thirty feet of compact Niagara limestone,
which is underlaid by about seventy feet of Niagara shale;
which in turn rests upon a compact stratum of Clinton limestone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
about twenty feet thick, which again is underlaid by a shaly deposit
of seventy feet, resting upon a compact stratum of Medina sandstone
twenty feet thick, below which a softer sandstone, that crumbles
somewhat readily, extends to the level of the river.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illo_009_fig3.jpg" width="600" height="398" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Looking up the gorge from near Lewiston, showing on the left the exposed situation
of the eastern face of the gorge at the extreme angle, where the measurements were made.</span>
</div>

<p>The present width of the river at the mouth of the gorge is
seven hundred and seventy feet. It is scarcely possible that the
original width of the gorge was here any less than this, for in the
narrowest places above, even where the Niagara limestone is much
thicker than at Lewiston, it is nowhere much less than six hundred
feet in width. Nor is it probable that the river has to any considerable
extent enlarged its channel at the mouth of the gorge at the
water level. On the contrary, it is more probable that the mouth
has been somewhat contracted, for the large masses of Niagara and
Clinton limestone and Medina sandstone which have fallen down as
the shales were undermined have accumulated at the base as a talus,
which the present current of the river is too feeble to remove. This
talus of great blocks of hard stone has effectually riprapped the
banks, and really encroached to some extent upon the original
channel.</p>

<p>We may therefore assume with confidence that the enlargement,
under suba&euml;rial agencies, of the mouth of the gorge at the top of
the escarpment has been no greater than the distance from the present
water's edge to the present line of the escarpment at the summit
of the Niagara limestone. This we found to be three hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
eighty-eight feet&mdash;that is, the upper stratum of hard rock on the
east side of the gorge had retreated that distance, through the action
of atmospheric agencies, since the formation of the gorge first began.
The accompanying photogravures and diagram will present the facts
at a glance. The total work of enlargement on the east side of the
gorge has been the removal of an inverted triangular section of the
rock strata three hundred and forty feet high and three hundred and
eighty-eight feet base, which would be the same as a rectangular
section of one hundred and ninety-four feet base. From this one
can readily see that if the average erosion has been at the rate of
one quarter of an inch per annum, the whole amount would have
fallen down in less than ten thousand years; while if the time is
lengthened, as some would have it, to forty thousand years, the rate
would be reduced to one sixteenth of an inch per year.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the construction of the railroad along the face of
the eastern wall of the gorge affords opportunity to study the rate
of erosion during a definite period of time. The accompanying
photogravures will illustrate to the eye facts which it is hard to
make impressive by words alone. The course of the road is diagonally
down the face of the gorge from its summit for a distance of
about two miles, descending in that space about two hundred feet
to the outcrop of hard quartzose Medina sandstone. The lower mile
of this exposure presents the typical situation for making an estimate
of the rate at which the face is crumbling away.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illo_011_fig4.jpg" width="400" height="492" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Nearer view of the upper portion of the face near
the mouth, showing the exposure of the situation at
that point.</span>
</div>

<p>Beginning at what used to be known as the "Hermit's Cave,"
near the Catholic College grounds, where the Niagara shale is well
exposed, and extending to the outer limit of the gorge, the height
of the face above the railroad averages one hundred and fifty feet.
Now, the crumbling away of the superincumbent cliffs gives continual
trouble to the road. Three watchmen are constantly employed
along this distance to remove the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> which falls down, and to give
warning if more comes down than they can remove before trains are
due. The seventy feet of Niagara shale, and the equal thickness of
shaly Medina rock which underlies the Clinton limestone, are constantly
falling off, even in fair weather, as any one can experience by
walking along the bank; while after storms, and especially in the
spring, when the frost is coming out, the disintegration proceeds at a
much more rapid rate. Sometimes two or three days are required by
the whole force of section hands to throw over the bank the result
of a single fall of material.</p>

<p>At a rate of one quarter of an inch of waste each year the amount
of <i>d&eacute;bris</i> accumulating for removal on the track along this distance
would be only six hundred and ten cubic yards per annum&mdash;that is,
if six hundred and ten cubic yards of material falls down from one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
mile of the face of the wall where it is a hundred and fifty feet
high, the whole amount of enlargement of the mouth of the gorge
would be accomplished in less than ten thousand years. Exact accounts
have not been kept by the railroad; but even a hasty examination
of the face of the wall makes it sure that the actual amount
removed has been greatly in excess of six hundred yards annually.
This estimate is based partly on the impression of the railroad officials
as to the cost of removal,
and partly on
the impressions of the
watchmen who spend
their time in keeping
guard and in the work
of removing it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illo_012_fig5.jpg" width="600" height="473" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;Showing extent of erosion at base of the Niagara shale since 1854.
(See description in the text.)</span>
</div>

<p>But that is not
all. The accompanying
photogravures indicate
an actual amount
of removal over a part
of the area enormously
in excess of the rate
supposed. Fig. 5 shows
a portion of the precipice,
a hundred feet
high, where the road
first comes down to the
level of the Clinton
limestone, and where,
consequently, the
whole thickness of the
Niagara shale is accessible
to examination. Fortunately, Patrick MacNamara, the watchman
at this station, was a workman on the road at the time of its
construction in 1854, and has been connected with the road ever
since, having been at his present post for twelve years. We have
therefore his distinct remembrance, as well as the appearance of
the bank, to inform us where the face of the original excavation
then was. In the picture he is standing at the original face, while
the other figure is nearly at the back of the space which has been
left empty by the crumbling away of the shale. The horizontal
distance is fully twenty feet, and the rocks overhang to that
amount for the whole distance exposed in the photograph. All this
amount of shale has fallen down in forty-four years, making a rate
many times larger than the highest we have taken as the basis of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
estimate. Of course, this rate for the crumbling away of the Niagara
shale on its fresh exposure is much in excess of the average rate for
a long period of time; but it is clear that the rate of erosion at the
base of the Niagara limestone at the mouth of the gorge can never
have been sufficiently slow to reduce the total average much below the
assumed rate of a quarter of an inch a year.</p>

<p>To impress the truth of this statement it is only necessary to follow
the progress, in imagination, of the crumbling process which has
brought the side of the gorge to its present condition. At first the
face of the gorge was perpendicular, the plunging water making the
gorge as wide at the bottom as at the top. At successive stages the
strata of shale on the side would crumble away, as is shown in our
photograph, and undermine the strata of hard rock. The large
fragments would fall to the bottom, and, being too large to be carried
away by the current, would form the talus to which we have
already referred, which would grow in height with every successive
century. The actual progress of the enlargement would thus be
periodic, and not capable of measurement by decades; but after centuries
the progress would be clearly marked, and especially whenever
there was a falling away of the lower stratum of compact Medina
sandstone, which is about two hundred feet below the top, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
a new cycle of rapid disintegrations in the superincumbent strata
follow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illo_013_fig6.jpg" width="600" height="422" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Section, drawn to equal vertical and horizontal scale, showing enlargement of Niagara
gorge on the east side at its mouth at Lewiston: 1, Niagara limestone, 20 to 30 feet;
2, Niagara shale, 70 feet; 3, Clinton limestone, 20 to 30 feet; 4, Clinton and Medina
shale, 70 feet; 5, Quartzose Medina sandstone, 20 to 30 feet; 6, softer Medina sandstone,
120 feet above water level.</span>
</div>

<p>An important point to be noticed, and which is evident from two
of the reproduced photographs (Figs. 3 and 4), is that the talus has
never reached up so high as to check the disintegration at the mouth
of the gorge of the Niagara shale and limestone which form the
upper one hundred feet of the face, and which exhibit the maximum
amount of enlargement which has taken place. The thickness of
the Niagara limestone is here so small that it has not been so important
an element in forming the talus as it has been farther up the
stream, where it is two or three times as thick. Now, while our
original supposition was that one quarter of an inch annually was
eroded from the upper two hundred feet, this would involve the
erosion of a half inch per annum over the top of the gorge to bring
the calculation within the limit of ten thousand years. It certainly
is difficult for one who examines the facts upon the ground to believe
that the crumbling away of this exposed Niagara shale could have
been at any less rate than that; so that the estimate of about ten
thousand years for the date of that stage of the Glacial period in
which Niagara River first began its work of erosion at Lewiston (an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
estimate which is supported by a great variety of facts independent
of those relating to the Niagara gorge) is strongly confirmed by
this new line of evidence.</p>

<p>So far as I can see, the only question of serious doubt that can be
raised respecting this calculation will arise from the possible supposition
that, when the eastern drainage over the Niagara channel began,
the land stood at such a relatively lower level as would reduce
the height of the fall to about half that of the present escarpment at
that point; when it might be supposed that a protecting talus had
accumulated which would interrupt the lateral erosion for the indefinite
period when the drainage was being drawn around by way
of the recently opened Lake Nipissing and Mattawa outlet. Then,
upon the resumption of the present line of drainage, with the land
standing at nearly its present level, the talus may have been undercut,
and so fallen down to leave the upper strata exposed as at present.
But there does not seem to be sufficient warrant for such a supposition
to make it necessary seriously to entertain it, while the objections to
it are significant and serious. First, the present narrowness of the
river at the water level is such that it does not give much opportunity
for enlargement after the first formation of the gorge; secondly,
the Niagara limestone at the mouth of the gorge is so thin (stated by
Hall to be twenty feet thick) that it would not form a protecting talus,
even at half its present height.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>P. S.&mdash;Since the above was written there has been reported in
the papers an immense fall of rock from the east side of the gorge,
near the head of the Whirlpool rapids. The estimate made of the
amount is one hundred thousand tons. If that estimate is correct,
it is a very impressive illustration of how the average fall of material
from the side of the gorge is occasionally increased by a single
instance. In making our calculations above, the total amount of
material annually falling off from the portion of the side of the gorge
under consideration amounted only to 1,237 tons, while the amount
of material was 611 cubic yards. But the 100,000 tons which came
off in a single slide a few weeks ago would be equal to twenty inches
in thickness from the whole face of the cliff, where our estimate was
only a quarter of an inch.</p>

<p>N. B.&mdash;In the diagram (Fig. 6) extend the Niagara shale (2) up
to occupy lower two layers of (1), thus making Niagara limestone (1)
half as thick as now.</p>

<h2>ABUSE OF PUBLIC CHARITY.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By BIRD S. COLER</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">COMPTROLLER OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK.</span></p>


<p>Ten per cent of all the human beings who die in New York city
are buried in Potter's Field at public expense; but the records
of organized charity, official and semiofficial, show that less than one
per cent of the living are paupers or dependent persons. There are
two explanations of the difference between the number of living poor
and penniless dead. The chief one is that abuse of public charity has
grown to such proportions that the city has become the Mecca of the
chronic idlers and tramps of the entire country. It is easier for an
industrious and shrewd professional beggar to live in luxury in New
York than to exist in any other city in the world. No magic wand
of ancient fable was ever more potent to unlock the gates of castle or
prison than the name of charity is to open a way to the public treasury.
The liberal and well-nigh indiscriminate giving of the money of
the taxpayers for the relief of sickness and poverty has been commanded
by law, sanctioned by custom, and approved by public
opinion until the possibility of checking or reforming the abuse
grows more and more remote as the burden increases and the evil
results multiply.</p>

<p>The city of New York gives annually to public charity more
than $5,000,000, and contributes indirectly $2,000,000 more. Of
the money raised by taxation for city purposes proper (State taxes,
interest, and county expenses eliminated), almost twelve per cent is
properly chargeable to relief of poverty and sickness. Of this expenditure
more than $3,000,000 is paid to private institutions and
societies over which the city authorities have no control or supervision.
The payments are made in compliance with the provisions of acts of
the State Legislature. The only provision in these laws that enables
the city officers to protect the treasury from fraud is a clause under
which the comptroller is permitted to verify the bills of the institutions
for the care of committed persons. There is a constitutional
safeguard against outright swindling of the city, in the requirement
that charitable institutions shall be inspected and their bills approved
by the State Board of Charities, but the system is open to many
abuses where the public officers are powerless.</p>

<p>The present comptroller of the city has found that a number of
alleged charitable institutions and societies receiving money from
the city apply nearly all their funds to the payment of salaries of
officers and employees, while their relief work is very limited and
of doubtful character. Other societies, he found upon investigation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
really encourage professional beggars without in any case relieving
deserving poor. A few cases were so flagrant in their abuse of public
charity that the further payment of city money to the societies was
refused. In one case he found that a society which claimed a board
of directors and numerous officers was really managed by one person,
who in one year had received $1,500 from the city and $70 from
all other sources, and had expended $1,300 of the amount for salaries
and $40 for the relief of the destitute.</p>

<p>The Department of Public Charities, for the maintenance of
which the sum of $1,941,215 is appropriated for the year 1899, is
controlled entirely by the city. The balance of the $5,000,000 appropriated
annually for the same general purpose is divided among
more than two hundred societies and institutions managed by corporations
or private individuals. In theory none of these private
institutions is supported by the city, the municipality merely paying
to them a fixed sum, which is supposed to be supplemented by private
donations. In reality nine tenths of them could not exist six months
without the money they receive from the public treasury. Very few
of these semipublic charities have an income from all other sources
equal to the appropriation from the city.</p>

<p>The city pays for the support of a child in a private institution
the sum of $110 a year, and the average allowance for the maintenance
of an adult is $150. The percentage of children among the
dependent persons is almost three to one, so the $5,000,000 public
charity fund would feed and clothe more than forty thousand persons
each year if applied directly to that purpose. In the distribution of
this great sum of public money, however, fully $2,000,000 of the
amount is absorbed in the payment of salaries and expenses, and
therein exists an abuse of public charity so great that the present
comptroller of the city some months ago appealed to the Legislature
for relief in the form of legislation which would enable the local
authorities to stop payments to many societies. There are numerous
small institutions, some of them having the indorsement and moral
support of leading citizens, that spend from sixty to eighty per cent
of all the money they receive in the payment of salaries, and in one
case discovered by the comptroller the expenses absorbed ninety-four
per cent of the total income of the society!</p>

<p>There is no evidence that any of these societies are deliberately
dishonest in their dealings with the city and the public. They are
as a rule conducted by men and women whose motives are good, but
who have no experience or practical knowledge to fit them for the
management of a charitable institution. They are easily imposed
upon by professional beggars, and in most cases fail in their well-meant
efforts to reach and relieve the deserving who are in actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
need. Most of the small organizations that waste public money in
misdirected charity are controlled by women of eminent respectability,
but with no knowledge whatever of the details of the work they
have undertaken. The result in many cases has been that they employ
enough help to absorb the bulk of the money received without
realizing that they are doing more harm than good.</p>

<p>The city does not spend its own money cheaply. Of the appropriation
of $1,941,215 for the support of the Department of Charities
for the current year the sum of $529,626 is allowed for the payment
of salaries of commissioners and employees. No private business
could long endure if conducted on such a basis. Some of the
institutions where hundreds of homeless waifs from the streets are
cared for&mdash;institutions semipublic in character, managed by men of
more than local reputation as experts in such work, societies founded
by men and women whose lives have been devoted to doing good&mdash;show
by their annual reports that more than half their income is
paid out in salaries. One institution that received $30,000 from the
city in 1898 and $20,000 from all other sources, reported a salary
account of $31,000. Another, receiving $100,000 from the city
and $120,000 in donations, had a salary account of $115,000. For
every five persons supported by public charity there are three persons
employed on salary in the work of relief. Of every five dollars paid
out by the city treasury to relieve the sick and destitute, two dollars
is absorbed by the salary and expense accounts.</p>

<p>The theory of the law under which city money is paid to private
charitable institutions is that they relieve the municipal authorities
of the care of a certain number of persons who would otherwise become
public charges to be maintained in the hospitals, asylums, or
homes owned by the city. It is also a popular theory that young
children who have become a public charge will receive better care and
training in a home controlled by a private society than they would in
a public institution. Appropriations and legislation are also obtained
by private organizations on the representation that for every
dollar paid to them by the city or State an equal amount will be
contributed by founders and subscribers. This representation is not
always true, and in many cases it happens that when a society begins
to receive money from the city private contributions fall off. When
the city authorities first took up the question of caring for homeless
and destitute persons and found that they had to deal with a grave
problem, some of the private charitable institutions were already in
existence and came forward with offers to share the burden. At that
time it was considered a good business arrangement for the city to
use private societies in the work of relief. This plan, it was expected,
would save the city considerable money, because the officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
of the societies would contribute their services, and the cost of applying
public charity to necessary relief would in that way be reduced to
a minimum. That expectation has not been realized. With the
rapid increase of necessity and demand for public relief the expenses
of administration of the societies have increased out of all proportion
to the work accomplished. In the beginning the city authorities
shirked a public duty, and by giving city money to private
persons who were willing to relieve them of a burden they invited
the creation of new societies and a steadily increasing demand for
more funds.</p>

<p>Of the two hundred and twenty charitable societies that receive
money from the city more than one hundred have been organized
during the past ten years. The records of the finance department
and the annual reports of these new organizations show that many
of them have received from the city sixty to ninety per cent of all
the funds they have handled, and that almost the same percentage of
their total income was charged to expenses, the chief item of expense
in every case being the payment of salaries to officers. Year
after year the promoters and officers of these small organizations
appear before the city authorities when the annual budget is to be
passed, and, attempting to excuse the poor showing they make, say, in
pleading for a larger appropriation, "We hope to do better next
year." The most liberal-minded defender of indiscriminate public
charity would find it difficult to excuse the existence of some of these
societies.</p>

<p>There are scores of small organizations helping to spend public
money that are unknown to the general public. In fact, some of
them are never heard of except when their officers appear before
the Board of Estimate once a year to ask for more money. There
is a society, organized for the purpose of supplying clothing to shipwrecked
sailors, which for several years obtained a small appropriation
from the city. When the officers requested an increase of the
amount allowed, the city authorities asked for some particulars of the
work done. The report submitted in reply showed that the society
had received, in addition to the money obtained from the city, several
donations of second-hand clothing and one box of wristlets (knit
bands to be worn on the wrists); had sent to a sailor shipwrecked
on the coast of Oregon a suit of underwear, a pair of hose, and
a rubber coat; to a crew wrecked on the reefs of Florida some shoes
and oilskin caps. There was no report of relief or clothing supplied
to a sailor or any other person in the city or State of New York,
but there was a charge for salaries that almost balanced the amount
received from the city treasury.</p>

<p>Another of the minor institutions is a society that is engaged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
an original method of charitable work. The agents of this society,
or the members themselves, go out into the slums of the city on
Sunday mornings and gather in a number of tramps. The homeless
wanderers are assembled in a room hired for the purpose and supplied
with a warm breakfast, after which they are compelled to
listen to a sermon and a lecture. They are then allowed to depart
and live as best they can until the following Sunday. For a number
of years this society has received a small appropriation from the
city on the ground that it is a useful public charity. To all of these
small societies, no matter what may be their alleged field of charitable
work, city money is appropriated without specific knowledge of
the exact purpose to which it is applied. By legislation or petition,
backed by the influence of prominent citizens, scores of these petty
organizations, some of them merely a fad or whim of an idle man
or woman, have been placed on the list of semipublic charities to
be aided at the expense of the taxpayers, and there they remain year
after year without so much as a serious inquiry as to their merits or
the work they accomplish. The city authorities who grant the appropriations
do not and can not know how the money they give to
such societies is to be expended, because they have no legal authority
to investigate the conduct of such institutions. The city officers,
therefore, are not to blame. The fault seems to rest primarily
upon that condition of public opinion that is cheerfully tolerant
of any fraud committed in the name of charity, and secondly upon
the members of the Legislature who vote without question or investigation
for all legislation asked for by any benevolent person or
society.</p>

<p>To the large charitable and correctional institutions of established
reputation, to which children or pauper adults are committed
by the local authorities, city money is appropriated on a business
basis. A fixed sum is paid for the support of each committed person,
and the taxpayers may know what they are getting for their money.
While the city authorities can not regulate the expenses or salaries
in these institutions, they know that the city is paying for a specific
service and that the work is performed. That it might be done
better or more cheaply need not concern them. But to the institutions
and societies that do not undertake to support dependent persons,
but engage in indiscriminate charitable work, the giving of city
money is as doubtful a method of relieving the deserving poor as
throwing coin in the streets.</p>

<p>The appropriation of city money made for 1899 direct to two
hundred and fifteen charitable and correctional institutions and societies
amounts to $1,784,846. The appropriations from the excise
funds to institutions that support pauper children and adults will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
slightly exceed $1,000,000. The county of New York pays to State
and private charitable institutions for the same period the sum of
$118,682; Kings County, $82,669; and Richmond County, $4,845;
all of which comes out of the general treasury. The money received
for licenses for theaters, concert and music halls, amounting to
$50,000 a year, is divided among eighty-two private societies and
institutions. This makes an aggregate of $3,000,000 paid out of the
city treasury annually and expended under the direction of private
organizations. With the exception of less than $100,000 it is all
appropriated under the provisions of special acts of the Legislature,
or sections of the city charter, and the city officers have no control
whatever over the methods of expenditure or the work undertaken
by the societies that receive the money. Under such
a system the possibilities for abuse of public charity are well-nigh
unlimited.</p>

<p>These direct appropriations of money do not represent all of the
city's contribution to the cause of charity. The property of all the
charitable institutions and societies is exempt from taxation and from
assessments for public improvements. The tax commissioners report
that the assessed value of the property of such organizations is
$70,781,990. At the present rate of taxation this means a loss to
the city of more than $1,400,000 a year. The assessments upon
the same property for public improvements exceed $100,000 a year,
which is paid by the city. These exemptions materially affect the
tax rate as well as the bonded indebtedness and annual interest
charges of the city, so that the yearly contribution of the taxpayers
of New York to charity is nearly if not quite $7,000,000,
or about fifteen per cent of the direct expenses of the city government.</p>

<p>Some figures from the budget for 1899 will show the relative
cost of caring for the poor. The city will pay for public education
$13,040,052; for police, $11,797,596; for the fire department,
$4,443,664; for the health department, $1,110,538; for
lighting, $2,000,000; for water, $1,450,817; for cleaning the streets,
$4,575,800; for parks, $1,729,235; for paving and repaving streets,
$2,520,099; and for charity direct and indirect, $7,000,000.</p>

<p>The chief abuses of the present system of public charity are the
extravagant expenditures for salaries and the steady and rapid increase
of pauperism due to the misdirected efforts of the inexperienced
persons who control so many of the smaller societies that receive
city money.</p>

<p>One of the oldest and most important charitable organizations in
the city is the Children's Aid Society. The report of the treasurer
for 1898 shows the following expenditures:</p>

<p>This shows a total salary account of $114,925.63, or about
thirty-seven per cent of the expenditure. The society received from
the city $100,764, and from general subscriptions and donations
$119,768. The balance of the income was derived from legacies,
endowments, special trust funds, and sale of bonds.</p>

<p>One of the private institutions in the city for the instruction of
deaf-mutes receives city, State, and county pupils under the provisions
of special acts of the Legislature. The report of the treasurer
for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1898, shows the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>The expenditures for the same period were $102,570.64, of which
$33,613.56 was for salaries and wages. This is a private institution
exempt from city or State control, subject to no governmental
supervision except examination by the State Board of Charities, yet
ninety per cent of its income is public money, and almost one third
of the cost of maintenance is charged to salaries and wages. These
two cases are mentioned not in criticism of the work or methods of
the institutions, but as representing a fair average of the salary
account of all the larger private charitable societies. They also
fairly represent the two extremes in the source of their income, one
receiving ninety per cent of public money, the other a little more
than thirty per cent.</p>

<p>Recent investigations conducted by the city comptroller and supplemented
by the agents of the State Board of Charities disclose
abuses in the expenditure of public money by certain small societies
so flagrant that the appropriations for the current year have been
withheld. In these cases the salary account was always the chief
expenditure, but it was also discovered that whatever relief got beyond
the headquarters of the societies went to professional beggars,
who had no difficulty in deceiving the persons in charge. It was
found that persons in good health had lived comfortably for months,
perhaps for years, on public charity dispensed through private organizations.
These professional beggars would obtain food at one
place, clothing at another, coal at a third, small sums of money from
all three perhaps, then reverse the order of application or appeal to
newer organizations if detection threatened. Relief was extended
in many instances with little or no effort on the part of the societies
to ascertain the merits of a case or the honesty of an applicant.</p>

<p>One small society was found to have expended practically all
of the money received from the city in the payment of the living
expenses of the person who had the entire management of the organization.
The charitable work of a year consisted in the distribution of
a small quantity of cast-off clothing and a few bushels of potatoes.
The reports of the society contained the names of directors who had
never served and knew nothing of the true condition of the organization.
They had merely consented that their names might be used
as a guarantee of reliability and to aid in the work of soliciting contributions.</p>

<p>One case has been found where a mother and daughter lived
comfortably by selling coal given to them by charitable societies.
One private institution, now abolished, boarded committed children
and received two dollars a week from the city for each child. The
children were fed on fish and potatoes at a cost of forty-four cents
each per week. After these facts were discovered the city authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
could not remove the children until the Board of Health condemned
and closed the building under the provisions of the sanitary code.
The minor abuses in the way of aiding undeserving persons extend
to nearly all the private societies that receive city money. Those
that exercise care and have been long established are often deceived
by professional beggars.</p>

<p>After his investigation of the subject the city comptroller established
in his office a bureau of examination for the purpose of placing
a check on the many small societies that indulge in indiscriminate
charity at the expense of the city, but he soon found that he was
powerless to correct all abuses. The present condition can not be
corrected and public charity placed upon a practical basis and limited
to the real necessities of the deserving poor until the city government
begins to deal with each society and institution upon its merits.
Changes and reforms to the present system will come in time, but
progress will be slow because charity is a valid excuse at the bar of
public opinion for the reckless expenditure of city money, and for
that reason it appeals strongly to the average politician and lawmaker.
Charity will cover with a mantle of commendation a multitude
of abuses and crave pardon for gross frauds. It is the pastime
of the rich and their gratuity to the poor. The magic of the word
seems to move a Legislature and open the treasure vaults of city and
State.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Dawson and Klondike City (South Dawson) in September, 1898.</span></span>
</div>

<p>A first impression of Dawson, in August, 1898, could not be
other than one calculated to bring up comparisons with strange
and foreign lands. As we saw it, approaching from the water side,
it persistently suggested the banks of the Yang-tse-kiang, or of some
other Chinese river, on which a densely apportioned population had
settled. Hundreds&mdash;one is almost tempted to say thousands&mdash;of boats
were lined up against the river front, and so packed in rows back
of one another that exit from the inner line was made possible only
by a passive accommodation from the outside. There were steam
craft, house-boats, scows, and a variety of minor bottoms, ranging
from the hay-packed raft to the graceful Peterboro canoe. Many
had canvas spread over them, giving house quarter to those who preferred
the economy of an owned estate to the high-priced cabins of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
log huts and hotels, and the purity of the open air to what was at
least considered to be the polluted atmosphere of the stable city. It
would be far from the truth to assume that this floating population
was composed exclusively of men, women, and children; there were
dogs galore, abundant by both presence and voice, horses and mules,
and an occasional goat betrayed itself munching among hay-packs
and the usual combination of simple and hard things which make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
up goat food. One canvas bore the tempting inscription "Hot and
Cold River Baths," several carried legends of variously designated
laundries, and a few even invited to "Board and Lodging, Cheap."
Of course, the word cheap had here a special etymologic significance,
and bore little relation to the same form of word which is current
in lexicons.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illo_032_mud.jpg" width="600" height="373" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Some Mud in the Main Street&mdash;First Avenue.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The first favorable impression of dry land in Dawson was tempered
by a knowledge that even here were many moist spots. The
mud lay in great pools along the main street&mdash;First Avenue or Front
Street&mdash;but hardly in sufficient depth to make walking dangerous.
Dogs and goats could alone drown in it. It is true that an occasional
wading burro or even a mule would find a dangerously low level, but
I am not aware that any in this condition had added to a list of
serious casualties. No mention is made in this connection of cats,
for, in truth, only two specimens of the feline family had up to this
time reached Dawson&mdash;one, a blue-ribboned kitten, which was endearingly
received as the mascot of the Yukon Mining Exchange.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illo_030_main.jpg" width="600" height="381" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Main Street in a Spring Freshet.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The Dawsonites are not entirely oblivious to the discomforts of
mud, for an effort is being made to block it out with sawdust, of
which the three or four sawmills in the town furnish a goodly supply.
In some parts a rough corduroy has been attempted, but the price of
lumber, two hundred dollars per thousand linear feet, renders this
form of construction too expensive for general use, especially in a
community all of whose members, female as well as male, are prepared
to stem the tide with high-top boots. About one half the
street length shows the pretense of wooden sidewalks, but no one
has yet recognized a special responsibility for repairs, or seemingly
considered that a continuous walk requires a continuous support.
Walking is a succession of ups and downs; boards are missing here,
other are smashed elsewhere, and the whole walk gives the impression
of having been in existence for centuries rather than for the period
of a short twelvemonth.</p>

<p>It was not difficult to determine what, perhaps, the majority of the
sixteen thousand inhabitants of Dawson were doing at the time of
our arrival. They were simply loitering, and the streets were packed
with humanity. This was not strange, either, for it must have been
difficult to resist the enjoyment of that open sunshine, that soft,
warm atmosphere which is the delight of the summer climate of the
far North. Never had I experienced anything comparable, and
others who had traveled much agreed with my experience. On my
way to the hotel, the "Fair View," which had been strongly recommended
for its <i>cuisine</i> and the circumstance that it was "brand"
new in its appointments&mdash;having only come into existence a few days
before&mdash;I caught a good general glimpse of the town, the dominant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
features of which were registered in the two sides of the main thoroughfare
along the river front. A nearly continuous row of one-story,
or at the utmost two-story, frame shacks or booths, many of
them still in canvas form, and most of them supported over the river's
bank by pile proppings, built up the river side of this First Avenue.
All manner of articles, both serviceable and unserviceable, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Klondike business were displayed, mostly in cramped quarters. The
variety of things that had in so brief a period found their way to this
region was truly astonishing, and one marveled at the mental ingenuity
which spirited some of these articles to a <i>champ de vente</i>.
Surely nothing but "manifest destiny" could have placed a mammoth's
molar on sale for a hundred dollars, when it was thought that
a period of starvation was reigning in the town. And yet almost
alongside of it were posters announcing that four loaves of bread
could be purchased for one dollar&mdash;in another place "six loves" for
the same price&mdash;and that "half an ounce" of gold dust, the equivalent
of eight dollars, would gain admission to the best seat witnessing
a boxing and wrestling contest.</p>

<p>In addition to the booths doing a regular merchandise business,
there were those whose masters ministered to a specialty&mdash;druggists
and doctors, photographers, auctioneers, and brokers of one kind or
another. "Bartlett Bros., Packers" served the inner core of the
gold regions by means of long trains of pack-mules, but they were not
the only ones to whom the <i>cargador</i> was an officer militant. Dog
teams there were as well as mule teams, and the majesty of the law
was hardly considered invaded when the former effected a junction
with man in the capacity of common carriers. One of the most interesting
sights was to me the large number of letters awaiting ownership
which were tacked up to the fronts and sides of different buildings,
in the most public way petitioning for rapid delivery. My
first letter in Dawson was obtained by stripping it from a door-jamb,
but it was three weeks before my attention had been directed to it
by a friendly discoverer. To obtain anything from the post office was
a most exhaustive process, and usually required a long wait, sometimes
of a day, or even of two days, before entry could be obtained
into the small room where the sorting, distribution, and dispensation
of mail matter were being effected. Even when finally issued,
this matter was usually of several weeks' antiquity of arrival, the
sorting of tons of substance being much beyond the capacity of the
few official hands that were engaged in the work.</p>

<p>By far the most imposing side of the street was that which faced
the river. Here, at least, were real buildings. The stately depots
of the Alaska Commercial and North America Trading and Transportation
Companies, with their outer casing of corrugated iron,
would have done credit to a town of larger capacity than Dawson, and
in regions much more accessible to civilization than the Northwest
Territory. Farther on, the signs of a number of well-built saloons&mdash;"The
Dominion," "The Pioneer," etc.&mdash;attract attention, not by
the supposition that they are alone in the business, since they are supported
by probably not less than two or three score others of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
kind, but by their specially distinctive interiors; one of these is embellished
inside by a series of four mural decorations in oil or distemper,
representing a range of subject from Morro Castle, Havana,
to a "Moonlight on the Yukon," for which a resident artist "of
promise," whose work was done in an open lot, received the handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
compensation of eight hundred dollars. They were befitting
the place which they graced.</p>

</div>

<p>A more intimate acquaintance with these saloons made it plain
that they were patronized both for the drinks which were sold over
the bar for fifty cents or more and for the gaming tables which
in open evidence betrayed a surpassingly strong interest in faro,
<i>rouge et noir</i>, and roulette. Crowds were watching the fortunes of
the play at every turn. From the front entrance quite to the rear
some of the more favored halls were packed, but with an element
that seemed little disposed to disturbance of any kind. While the
drinking of spirituous liquors is very largely indulged in, I believe
that during all my stay in Dawson only three cases of obtrusive
drunkenness were brought to my attention; and of riotism my experience
was wholly negative. Life and property are considered safe
even in the most doubtful establishments, and it is not uncommon for
a man to pass hours in a crowded dance hall with virtually all his
possessions, possibly a few hundred dollars, or it may be thousands,
carried in the form of gold dust in his trousers pockets. Two main
factors are involved in this condition of security or in the feeling that
it exists. The first of these is, perhaps, a wholesome dread of the
Canadian Mounted Police, whose efficiency in the direction of controlling
order is conceded by every one; and the second, the circumstance
that the inhabitants of Dawson and of the adjoining Klondike
region are not, as is so largely supposed, a mere assortment of rough
prospectors, intent upon doing anything for the sake of acquiring
gold, but a fair representation of good and indifferent elements borrowed
from all professions and stations of life, and not from one country
alone, but from nearly all parts of the civilized globe. During
my brief stay I stumbled upon "counts," "sirs," military and naval
officers, scientists, lawyers, newspaper men, promoters, and others of
broad and liberal standing; and if some of these were undistinguishable
in external garb from their brethren in mustard-colored mackinaws
whose sole resource was digging for gold, their polished and
intellectual method was evidence enough that civilization was present
in good quantity along the upper Yukon. The fact that there are
three weekly newspapers published in Dawson&mdash;the Nugget, Midnight
Sun, and Dawson Miner, the first two selling for fifty cents a
copy and the last for twenty-five cents&mdash;can hardly be considered to
prove this condition, although favoring it; for, though the substance
and especially the typography of the journals are quite good, the demand
for reading matter is such that almost anything could realize
a subscription list. The long-belated New York journals seem to
command a steady sale on the news stands, where one also sees displayed
the small and (in our country) gratuitously distributed scenic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
book of the transcontinental railways put up for fifty cents. The
Argosy, Strand, Munsey's, and Cosmopolitan were the ruling magazines
during my visit, and each of these could be had for seventy-five
cents a number.</p>

<p>Regretfully must it be said that the female portion of the population
does not sustain the male either in character or diversity. I tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
in various ways to ascertain the number of women who represented
the community, but failed to obtain a satisfactory accounting. A
large proportion of those who are in evidence, and perhaps even by
far the greater number, belong to the "red" aristocracy, or at least
to that side where steady principles are treated with little consideration
and respect. I use the word aristocracy advisedly, for it is a
notorious fact that an amount of deference is paid to these creatures
of shame which is not given to the virtuous or self-respecting woman;
and that they themselves, recognizing their standing, are apt to look
down upon the rest of their kin, and to even question their proper
privileges. A large part of the broadly capacious Second Avenue,
together with equally conspicuous sections of the town elsewhere,
is given up to the public display of the inmates of neatly constructed
log cabins bearing such devices as "Saratoga," "Bon-Ton," "The
Lucky Cigar Store," "Green Tree," etc. The number of open houses
is probably less than in most mining camps, and far below what it is
in some places. In deference to a demand tax of fifty dollars, levied
on each member of the profession to pay part costs of two fire engines
which had been brought to the town, there was a response of only
sixty-nine, and this was considered a sufficiently close representation
not to press the matter any further.</p>

<p>A community of this kind must necessarily have its dance halls
and places of amusement. The latter consisted at the time of my
arrival of four "theatres" or "opera houses"&mdash;the "Combination,"
"Monte Carlo," "Mascot," and "Pavilion," two of which suspended
or closed up before the "season" had fairly opened. Ordinarily,
the price of a drink at the bar of entrance paid for admission to the
performance with seat, and many will agree with me in believing that
the admission was fully paid. The acting need not be worse at any
theater, and the singing could hardly be surpassed in its eccentricities;
yet the performances appeared to satisfy a general demand, as ordinarily
the houses were packed to their full capacity evening after
evening. Needless is it to say that the performances are not intended
for women in good standing, and few such are ever present, unless
heavily screened behind the curtains of the "boxes." The plays are
all of a low order, but the worst is not much worse than some of
the plays that are tolerated in all their nastiness in some of our own
legitimate theaters. It is singular and interesting as showing the
influence of necessity that a sacred Sunday concert in aid of the fire
department was successfully carried through in the capacious halls
of one of the most notorious dancing resorts.</p>

<p>There are now two banks in Dawson&mdash;the Bank of British North
America and the Canadian Bank of Commerce. In the early days of
August the first of these was still housed in a tent, and before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
end of the month a stately wooden structure with flagstaff, and with
commodious quarters for the representing officers and accountants,
gave dignity to the institution, while it lent style to the corner upon
which it was erected. Adjoining it now is the architecturally most
imposing but by no means largest building in Dawson&mdash;the three-storied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
bow-windowed log cabin of Alexander McDonald, the recognized
"King of the Klondike"&mdash;intended primarily as an office building.
It is a truly fine expression of the art of log-cabin building.
In many ways one of the most interesting buildings, if such it can
be called, was the air space, with canvas top, which adjoined one of
the theaters and was used by Signor Gandolfo for a fruit store.
There was no architectural quality to commend this space; nor, indeed,
was there anything else in its favor, except that it was in the
right place and brought both lessor and lessee fortunes. For the
privileges of this space of five feet width the occupant paid the handsome
rental of one hundred and twenty dollars a month, or twenty-four
dollars per single foot of frontage; his profits were, however,
such as to justify this payment, and before leaving he confided to
me his plan of renting one half of the establishment. Conceive of
the character of a store five feet wide, the opposite sides of which
are devoted to quite distinct interests! Other sites rent for very
little less, and the singular part of it is that much of the rental
goes to the pockets of certain assumed owners, whose actual rights
are largely in the nature of a "grab" or of squatter sovereignty
alone.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p>Dawson extends up the river for about two miles, virtually
coalescing with and taking in what has been euphoniously called
Lousetown and also Klondike City. These more southerly parts
carry with them certain characteristics which are either wanting in
the main city or are there but feebly represented. The closely packed
tents remind one of an army gathering or of the furniture of some
religious camp meeting; walking between them might almost be considered
to be a branch of navigation. Inscriptions on the canvas tell
us of certain "brothers from St. Louis" being occupants here, and
of "the Jolly Four from&mdash;&mdash;" occupants elsewhere. Representatives
of the press, physicians, and attorneys all have their inscriptions.
But the most interesting constructions, picturesque as much as they are
instructive, are the elevated platform <i>caches</i>, diminutive log cabins,
which on high stilts store a multitude of articles in safe keeping and
beyond reach of the army of hungry dogs which are everywhere
prowling about and carousing upon all manner of odds and ends.
Their appearance, especially where they are placed among trees
and bushes, is such that the observer can hardly resist the feeling
that he is traveling in a region of primitive pile-dwellings&mdash;it may
be the interior of New Guinea or the forest tract of one of the
Guianas.</p>

<p>Dawson, which now owns the right to celebrate its third anniversary,
is destined before long to assume a modern garb. It already
has its electric plant, and before many months have passed electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
illumination will lift the burden of the dark winter night. It is
believed, too, that an electric railroad for freight and passenger
service will be constructed in the course of the present year into the
heart of the adjoining gold region. The tiresome accounts of bad
trails will then be a thing of the past. In its business aspects Dawson
does not materially differ from the majority of the boom towns of
the United States, though of course it has its peculiarities. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
period of little more than a year it has gathered to itself, besides the
usual class of merchants, representatives of a number of professions,
such as doctors, lawyers, chemists, and assayers, most of whom, especially
of the first two classes, appeared to be doing at least fairly
well. Mine brokers, or simply venders of claims, are numerous, but
their service does not in most cases sustain confidence; the display
of posters announcing "bonanzas" in mining properties may be
effective at times, but ordinarily the investor turns either to the
Mining Exchange, a reasonably well-conducted private enterprise, or
to claim-holders on the ground. The auction of claims at the Exchange
was always largely attended at the times of my visits, and the
bidding was frequently very spirited. The allowance of a time limit
of ten days in which to make an examination of properties purchased
and of the titles thereto before payment, beyond a forfeit of ten per
cent, was exacted, naturally inspired confidence in the method of the
transaction, and there is no question that a considerable number of
good properties were parted over the boards here, and with eminent
satisfaction to the purchasers.</p>

<p>The practice of medicine is necessarily governed by the laws
which are in effect in the Dominion of Canada, and it requires the
possession on the part of the practitioner of a diploma properly accredited
from some recognized college of medicine in Canada.
Graduation with diploma from the best medical schools in the United
States is not considered to meet the requirement&mdash;nor, for that matter,
is the diploma of any but a British school. This restriction also
applies in the case of professional trained nurses. A number of cases
closely bordering on litigation, and at one time even threatening to
bring about international complications, have arisen in connection
with practice violating this law; but despite the overwhelmingly large
number of foreigners who are resident in the region, and who, it was
thought by some, had the right to consult practitioners of their own
nationality or choice, there is now a peaceful submission to the
reading of the statute. The exaction is in no way intended to legislate
against foreigners, but is simply a provision of the Dominion
laws, similar to that which requires a "Dominion surveyor" who
intends doing official survey work in British Columbia to be properly
accredited with a special paper of that section of Canada (as distinguished
from the Northwest Territory, etc.). Like the physicians,
all surveyors giving out work under their names must be officially
licensed from the Dominion, although those not thus certificated are
permitted to do office or field work for others who are.</p>

<p>A field of labor that has already been entered upon by women is
stenography and typewriting. There has been considerable demand
for this kind of work, and there will continue to be much more, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
it may be doubted if profits arising from it will ever equal what has
been attained in millinery and the sale of fancy dress goods. One of
the earliest milliners to come out of Dawson told me at Bennett
that she had disposed of a hat which brought her two hundred and
eighty dollars (in April, 1898), and its only ornamentation was two
black ostrich feathers! Such prices are to-day a thing away in the
past, but fur capes or circulars are still marketable for three hundred
dollars and upward.</p>

of business now followed in Dawson we subjoin a facsimile of portions

<h2>THE NEGRO QUESTION.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By J. L. M. CURRY, LL.D.</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">GENERAL AGENT OF THE PEABODY EDUCATION FUND AND OF THE JOHN F. SLATER EDUCATION
FUND; LATE MINISTER TO SPAIN.</span></p>


<p>The negro question is not of recent origin. The Iliad of our
woes began in 1620, when negroes were first brought to the
colony of Virginia and sold as slaves. Slavery antedates history.
The traffic of Europeans in negroes existed a half century before the
discovery of America. The very year in which Charles V sailed
with a powerful expedition against Tunis to check the piracies of the
Barbary states, and to emancipate enslaved Christians in Africa, he
gave an open legal sanction to the African slave trade. When independence
was declared in 1776 all the colonies held slaves. Slavery,
said the late Senator Ingalls, disappeared from the Northern States
"by the operation of social, economic, and natural laws," and "the
North did not finally determine to destroy this system until convinced
that its continuance threatened not only their industrial independence
but their political importance." In course of years "the
peculiar institution" assumed a sectional character. The war between
the States precipitated a crisis. President Lincoln began then
the work of emancipation. "As commander-in-chief of the army
and navy in time of war, I suppose I have the right to take any
measure which may best subdue the enemy.... I view the measure
[the Proclamation] as a practical war measure according to the advantages
or disadvantages it will offer to the suppression of the
rebellion." Senator Ingalls's testimony is as follows: "It may be
admitted that the emancipation of the slaves was not contemplated
by any considerable portion of the American people when the war
for the Union began, and it was not brought to pass until the fortunes
of war became desperate, and was then justified and defended upon
the plea of military necessity." The Southern States ratified the
amendments to the Constitution under penalty of otherwise remaining
out of the Union and in political and military vassalage.
The abolition of slavery has the assent of all sane men. Apart from
ethical considerations, the subjection of the will, thought, or labor
of a mature human being to the whim, caprice, or legal right of
another is a gross political and economical blunder, unwise and indefensible.
After emancipation came citizenship and enfranchisement
of the freedmen, and the punitive measures of reconstruction,
which were the outcome of hatred, revenge, desire for party ascendency,
and which no good man can now approve. No conquering
nation ever inflicted on a conquered people more cruel injustice than
the disfranchisement of the most capable citizens and the enfranchisement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
of liberated slaves. Certain great civil rights are the necessary
and proper consequences of freedom. Suffrage is not a natural right,
nor a legal, political, or general result of freedom or citizenship. The
large majority of citizens do not and can not vote.</p>

<p>The liberation of millions of slaves was the most gigantic and,
in itself, one of the most beneficent acts of this century. Nothing
is comparable to it as a triumph of the inalienable rights of man.
Humanity and justice demanded emancipation. Re-enslavement no
one proposes or desires. All would rejoice in the prosperity and
progress of the Afro-American, but with freedom came citizenship
and suffrage, and these revolutionized our Government. Elements
undreamed of were introduced as constituents. When the Constitution
and the resulting Union were formed, such a citizenship with
franchise was not proposed, and if proposed would not have been
listened to for a moment. The most infatuated negrophilist would
not stultify himself by asserting that the Union of States would or
could have been consummated with the present incongruous, heterogeneous
citizenship.</p>

<p>From these and other facts has been evolved what has been called
the negro problem. In the discussion, it is best to eliminate all
extraneous considerations, all issues which, as the lawyers say, are
"<i>dehors</i> the record." Government is a very practical business.
The end is the securing and preserving the peace, safety, and well-being
of the State. Civil government has no mission of general
philanthropy. This problem, while of terrific importance in the
South, where the black population is persistently congestive, is not,
in its ramifications or direct effects, local or sectional. It affects
every community and every section. It is of paramount national
importance, complex, and involving social, moral, and political considerations.
Its gravity can not be exaggerated. It compels the
attention and demands all the resources of patriots, philanthropists,
statesmen. It thrusts itself, uninvited and unwelcomed, into religious
and social assemblies and legislative councils. It is pervasive,
continuing, vital. It is better to look it full in the face and give it
dispassionate thought.</p>

<p>It need scarcely be said that in this discussion no hostile reference
is made to individuals. Some negroes are men of intelligence,
integrity, patriotism, and stand on a plane with our best citizens in
virtues and mental qualifications.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> The gist of this contention is
not based on special exceptions, but on the race in the aggregate.</p>

<p>We find in the South the presence of two distinct peoples, with
irreconcilable racial characteristics and diverse historical antecedents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
The Caucasian and the negro are not simply unlike, but they are
contrasted, and are as far apart as any other two races of human
beings. They are unassimilable and immiscible without rapid degeneracy.
Ethnologically they are nearly polar opposites. With
the Caucasian progress has been upward. Whatever is great in art,
invention, literature, science, civilization, religion, has characterized
him. In his native land the negro has made little or no advancement
for nearly four thousand years. Surrounded by and in contact
with a higher civilization, he has not invented a machine, nor painted
a picture, nor written a book, nor organized a stable government,
nor constructed a code of laws. He has not suppressed the slave
trade, which, according to recent testimony, was never more flourishing.
He has no monuments nor recorded history. For thousands
of years there lies behind the race one dreary, unrelieved, monotonous
chapter of ignorance, nakedness, superstition, savagery. All efforts
to reclaim, civilize, Christianize, have been disastrous failures, except
what has been accomplished in this direction in the United States.</p>

<p>It need not be disguised, for it is the ever-present, indisputable
fact, that while there are alleviations of the unpleasantness, the relations
between the negroes and their co-citizens of the Caucasian race
are strained and unsatisfactory. The friction, the prejudice, the
cleavage, is not between Teutonic and Latin on the one side and
Semitic on the other, nor between Saxon and Celt; it lies deeper,
yields less readily to palliatives and remedies, and seems a matter of
adjustment for the remotest future. It may help to understand the
situation if we analyze its causes.</p>

<p>The great revolution suddenly transformed the customs, traditions,
and conditions of the two races. Ownership gave way to freedom;
compulsory and wage-unrewarded labor to absolute control of
person; inequality, inferiority, subjection, to equality in the eye of
the law; restrained locomotion to license of movement; kindness,
interest in life, wealth, and physical welfare, to suspicion, distress,
alienation. With property in man, regulated and enforced by laws
in the interest of the master, labor was organized, directed by intelligent
control to the development of agricultural resources and to
the building up of a society which for refinement of manners, hospitality,
and administrative capacity, has elicited praise from disinterested
travelers and investigators. The negro, whatever he may
have attained from the discipline of slavery, was not cultivated in
intelligence, in manual skill, in forethought, power of initiative, in
thrift, and the comforts and graces of home life. When freed,
many were deluded by deceptive promises. They construed freedom
to mean a division of property. Release from bondage led
to intemperance and extravagance. Accustomed to control, unaccustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
to self-reliance, having others to think, plan, buy, and sell
for them, to supply wants, to watch over them from the cradle to the
coffin, many, when left to themselves, reverted to primitive habits,
and became idle and worthless. Slavery had cursed the South with
ignorant, unskilled, uninventive labor. Freedom did not change its
character. The war, liberation of slaves, the sudden extinguishment
of millions of property, bankrupted the South. Subsistence,
recovery of means of living, rehabilitation, reorganization of those
agencies, which are, with intelligent work, the chief means of the
wealth of civilized peoples, became the first duty after hostilities
ceased. This demanded steady, persistent industry, the change of
former methods of agriculture, subdivision of farms, diversification
of pursuits, opening of academies and colleges, and establishment of
public schools for free and universal education. The contrast between
the wealth and prosperity of the North and South presents an
appalling picture. Naturally, the Southern people were in despair,
and too often they vented their dissatisfaction, their rage, upon the
irresponsible and unoffending negro.</p>

<p>Slavery <i>per se</i> is not conducive to self-restraint of the enslaved, to
high ethical standards, and the best types of human life. When the
interest and authority of owners were removed and former religious
instruction was crippled or withdrawn, the negroes fell rapidly from
what had been attained in slavery to a state of immorality, and, in
some cases, to original fetichism. Some remained immovable in
their former faith, but many, especially of the younger generation, of
both sexes, gave proof of what degeneracy can accomplish in a quarter
of a century. It is very common for them to divorce religion and
piety. Artificial excitement, passionate emotion, was substituted for
a faith which should be the product of a knowledge of and deep reverence
for the Word of God. The danger of doing harm, or injustice,
restrains my pen from disclosing a mass of disgusting material which
could only shock sensibilities and stagger credulity. It is, besides,
very easy to magnify our own virtues and others' vices. It is a prevalent
mode of religiousness to repent of other people's sins, and to get
superfluous merit by showing how others fall short of our attainments.
Lowell said, "Everybody has a mission (with a capital M) to
attend to everybody else's business," and "to make his own whim the
law, and his own range the horizon of the universe." We have all
read of the philanthropic Mrs. Jelliby neglecting home and children
to sweeten the lot of the unregenerate natives of Borrioboola Gha.
Still, testimony, to satisfy the most skeptical, could be adduced <i>ad
nauseam</i>, from men and women doing educational and missionary
work among the colored people, to show the deplorable depths into
which multitudes have sunk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the Reconstruction Acts there was a deliberate, predetermined
attempt and purpose to put the freedmen in control of the
Southern States. The late slaves were enfranchised; the best class
of white men were disfranchised. The law presumes that a man or
a State intends the logical consequence of acts done. In South Carolina,
Mississippi, and Louisiana a majority of the voters, under the
coerced policy, were negroes. In other States they were so numerous
that a combination with a small fraction of white voters would give
the ascendency. In Virginia, a coalition between non-taxpaying
white people and negroes, under skilled and bold leadership, accomplished
partial repudiation of the State debt. Superadd to this undisguised
Federal intent the hungry adventurers who, as governors,
judges, marshals, district attorneys, etc., flocked like vultures around
the carcass, the horde of persons whose object was to pilfer and plunder,
who played upon the ignorance, the superstitions, and gratitude
of the negro and made the credulous victims believe that their former
masters were not to be trusted in elections, and you have a picture
which imagination fails to realize. The negroes, neither by apprenticeship,
nor political education, not intellectual culture, were prepared
for the boon, and their unscrupulous friends organized them
into secret societies and inflamed hopes and expectations of wealth
and dominancy. Casper Hauser transferred from a dungeon to a
throne would be a fit illustration of this defiance of all the teachings
of the past. Suffrage was a wrong to the nation, to the States, to
the white and black races, and especially to the negro. Negro suffrage
is a farce, a burlesque on elections, and only evil. The negroes
generally vote as puppets, as machines, and have not the remotest
conception of the character or effect of the act they are ignorantly
performing, or of the issues involved in the contest, or of the functions
or duties of the officers voted for. Huxley says, "Voting power
as a means of giving effect to opinion is more likely to prove a curse
than a blessing to the voter, unless that opinion is the result of a
sound judgment operating upon sound knowledge." This premature
investiture of the negro with suffrage reciprocally provoked alienation,
bitterness, strife, and a resolute purpose on the part of the
white people not to submit to the misrule and tyranny of ignorance
and pauperism, but to resort to all necessary methods to defeat such
a result.</p>

<p>It is needless to recapitulate the facts of many thousand years
in order to raise the inference of racial difference between the Caucasian
and the negro. The immigration to our country is the proof
of antagonism of races. The foreigner stays away from the South;
so in a large degree does the Northern man. Notwithstanding the
unsurpassed climate, the rivers and gulf and mountains, the fertile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
soil, the varied products, the hospitable welcome, the territory occupied
by the negro is persistently avoided. By the census of 1880 the
proportion of foreign-born in all the former slave States was 3.5 per
cent; in the Northern States about twenty per cent; in eight Southern
States, where the negroes abound, there was in 1880 only one
and a third per cent who were of foreign birth. Mr. Lincoln, in
1858, in accounting for the repulsion, said: "There is a physical
difference between the two races which will probably forbid their
living together upon the footing of perfect equality.... I am not,
or ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor
of qualifying them to hold office, nor of intermarrying with white
people." Absorption, assimilation, is not to be dreamed of. The
negro is no nearer common fellowship, equality of association, than
he was in 1865. Reconstruction measures, constitutional amendments,
sword and bayonet, ecclesiastical anathemas, fulminations of
press and pulpit, all power of church and state and public opinion,
have not altered, can not alter, what seems ineradicable. Race antagonism
reaches deeper than political affiliation. If every negro
at the South were to vote the Democratic ticket in every subsequent
election, the race division would remain the same.</p>

<p>Can these differences be effaced, alienations be healed, and overshadowing
perils be averted? What concerns the patriot is to find
a solution for this gigantic and appalling problem. The statesman
has not yet arisen, disposed to grapple with the problem, or capable
of suggesting a feasible and efficacious remedy. With the least hardship
to the negro, proper recognition of his rights as a man, due
regard to the just ends of our Government, and the purposes of its
founders, some scheme, if possible, wise, adequate, and comprehensive,
should be devised. Whatever hitherto has been suggested has
been met with opposition and is justly liable to criticism. The most
obvious remedy, and which has been tried with some success, is to
uplift the race by means of public schools and proper religious instruction.
All honor to the schools that train the youth into self-respecting
manhood and womanhood! All honor for the efforts that
are making to correct the debasement of slavery, to unite faith and
practice, to infuse religious life with an ethical Christianity, and
to form a moral basis for life and character! The crimes of both
races in the South, pushed within the last few years to most brutal
atrocities, show that there can be no safety for free institutions, no
guarding against savage degradation, if either race be kept in crass
ignorance. Both must suffer. It would be some relief from ballot-box
evils and perils if the examples of New England and of Louisiana,
Mississippi, and South Carolina were followed by all the States. As
"universal suffrage has no anchorage except in the people's intelligence,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Massachusetts requires of voters a prepayment of taxes, and
voting and office-holding are limited to those who can read the Constitution
in the English language and write their names. What has
been done by States, denominations, and individuals through schools
is not discouraging to larger and better efforts, but is a stimulus to
and an assurance of excellent results. The plantation system of the
South, when land was in the hands of a few territorial magnates, was
of very doubtful utility. A bold peasantry is a country's pride, and
a small farmer should take the place of the large landed proprietor.
If the negroes should acquire and hold more real estate, they would
be of more value as citizens, and would have increased interest in the
stability of laws, enforcing of contracts, and the preservation of
State honor. An enlargement of the number of those who have a
solid stake in the well-being of the country would be adding to the
ranks of natural supporters of law and honor, and strengthening the
true foundations on which the stability of a republican government
must rest.</p>

<p>The congestion of the negroes aggravates the difficulties and dangers
of the problem. The area of the States holding slaves in 1860
was 901,740 square miles, and of the Northern States, excluding
Alaska, 2,123,860 square miles. By the census of 1890, the total
population of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia,
and West Virginia, was 37.3 per cent of negroes and 62.7 per cent
of whites; or, including Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri,
30.7 per cent of negroes and 69.3 per cent of whites. The
African citizens are localized within a narrow area. A French
statesman said, "Cross the Pyrenees and Africa begins." Cross
Mason and Dixon's line, or the Ohio and Potomac Rivers, and in a
truer sense Africa begins, for south of that line the negroes are
massed. It has been nearly forty years since slavery existed, for
no one born since 1860 was ever practically a slave, and yet freedom
has not diffused the seven million and a half of Africans. Despite
all the traditions of bondage, all the misrepresentations of modern
literature, all the exaggerated accounts of intimidation and cruelty,
the South remains the home of the negro. When he is told that
equality, friendship, political sympathy, and good wages may be secured
by passing an invisible geographical line, he persistently refuses
to be seduced across. Senator Windom, of Minnesota, advocated a
plan for distributing by assisted emigration, but nothing came of
it. Senator Edmunds, in discussing the Chinese question, said:
"The people of Massachusetts would not be hungry for an eruption
of a million of the inhabitants of Africa, ... because they believe,
either by instinct or education, that it is not good for the two races<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
to be brought into that kind of contact in that place.... The fundamental
idea of a prosperous republic must be a homogeneity of its
people."</p>

<p>Colonization as a remedy has had many strong advocates. As
early as 1800 the Assembly of Virginia, in secret session, instructed
the Governor to correspond with the President with the object of procuring
a colony to which the negroes could be sent. Jefferson began
the correspondence. The Legislature resumed the question, and
expressed its preference for "Africa or any of the Spanish or
Portuguese settlements in South America" as the place "to which
free negroes or mulattoes, and such negroes or mulattoes as may be
emancipated," might be sent or choose to remove. In 1805 the
members of Congress were instructed to endeavor to procure suitable
territory in Louisiana. In 1811, being asked his opinion as to a
settlement on the coast of Africa, Jefferson replied that "nothing
is more to be wished than that the United States would themselves
undertake to make such an establishment on the coast of Africa."
In 1813 the Legislature openly and almost unanimously adopted, for
the third time, resolutions similar to those of 1800. The same year
the Colonization Society was formed, out of which grew the Republic
of Liberia. President Lincoln, in his first annual message, December,
1861, referring to the two classes of liberated persons that might
be thrown upon Congress for their disposal, recommended "that in
any event steps be taken for colonizing both classes at some place or
places in a climate congenial to them. It might be well to consider,
too, whether the free colored people already in the United States could
not be included in such colonization." Congress responded by voting
one hundred thousand dollars for the voluntary emigration of
freedmen from the District of Columbia to Haiti or Liberia, and
later, in July, 1862, gave five hundred thousand dollars for the
colonization of negroes in some tropical country beyond the limits
of the United States. Mr. Lincoln continued to favor the policy of
removal to another country, and five days after signing the above act
he read to his Cabinet a proposed order for "the colonization of
negroes in some tropical country." Burdened with this great question,
amid the exigencies of the mighty war, he continued to push
the matter, and had Secretary Seward send a circular letter to
England, France, the Netherlands, and Denmark, with regard to
colonizing the negroes in some of their tropical possessions. Offers
came from the Danish West Indies, Dutch Surinam, British Guiana,
Honduras, Haiti, New Granada, and Ecuador. Mr. Lincoln considered
the offers from New Granada and an island off Haiti, and
even sent a colony to the latter. Again, in his annual message in
1862, he argued for colonization, and asked for an appropriation, but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
under the passions of the terrible conflict then raging, the Congress,
instead of heeding the request, repealed the former act appropriating
five hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The Indians, against their will, were transported, by coercive measures,
to allotted lands beyond the Mississippi, but that was before
the modern discovery that the United States should grant "fraternity
and assistance to all people" under other than republican governments,
and that universal suffrage was the infallible expedient
for civilizing semibarbarous peoples. President Harrison, in his
letter of acceptance, writing on another subject, says, "We are
already under a duty to defend our civilization by excluding alien
races whose ultimate assimilation with our people is neither possible
nor desirable."</p>

<p>Remedies, strong and adequate and feasible, may not be found
readily, but there are gentler and quieter agencies which may be
used by both races to mutual advantage. The white people, in accepting
the legitimate consequences of defeat, in vigorous efforts to restore
antebellum prosperity, in establishing schools, in reconstructing
shattered society, have done nobly, but they are not without sin.
Laws, general and wise and impartial, on the statute-book need for
their enforcement a sustaining public opinion, but this has not always
been forthcoming. Lawless and violent proceedings, always unnecessary
and demoralizing, sometimes as brutal as the crimes which
excited horror; harsh and unjust contracts; interferences in elections;
false registration and counting of votes, and other acts which
the plea of self-preservation did not justify, have evinced the harshness
and injustice of dominant power, and have not tended to soften
prejudices or make the situation more tolerable. Each race is fortunately
improving in intercourse and in dealings with the other,
and time and sober judgment are, in a sensible degree, removing
causes of alienation which are not inherent and incurable.</p>

<p>"What a blessing," said President Sir John Lubbock, at the late meeting
of the International Congress of Zo&ouml;logists, "it would be for mankind
if we could stop the enormous expenditure on engines for the destruction
of life and property, and spend the tenth, the hundredth, even the thousandth
part on scientific progress! Few people seem to realize how much
science has done for man, and still fewer how much more it would still
do if permitted. More students would doubtless have devoted themselves
to science if it were not so systematically neglected in our schools; if men
and boys were not given the impression that the field of discovery is well-nigh
exhausted. We, gentlemen, know how far that is from being the
case. Much of the land surface of the globe is still unexplored; the ocean
is almost unknown; our collections contain thousands of species waiting to
be described; the life-histories of many of our commonest species remain
to be investigated, or have only recently been discovered."</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS AND AMERICAN CAPITAL.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By J. RUSSELL SMITH.</span></p>


<p>That the Philippine Islands are of value as a place for investment
is an unexplained generalization that is now being
used to tempt business men. The object of this article is to discuss
this generalization. The idea that the Philippine Islands are of importance
to us, as a new field for our industrial developments, depends
upon two assumptions: First, that we need to go beyond the bounds
of the United States; second, that the Philippines offer the best
available field for the satisfaction of that need.</p>

<p>As to the first assumption, the occasion and origin of the demand
for the retention of the Philippines furnish presumptive evidence
that it represents no real economic want of the American people.
No one ever thought of it until we heard the boom of Dewey's
guns at Manila. The demands that then arose for Eastern territory
were the natural result of a just pride in the amazing triumph
of our navy. Before the battle of Manila a suggestion that we
should take the Philippines and <span class="smcap lowercase">RECEIVE</span> $20,000,000 as a bonus we
would have deemed preposterous. Before that battle, one idea was
uppermost in the minds of the American people&mdash;namely, the development
of the American continent. And yet, along with the enthusiasm
over the accomplishments of our army and navy, the idea
has crept into some minds that we are in need of more land to develop,
and that we must find it in the Eastern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>Examination of the internal condition of the United States does
not seem to indicate such need. Our exports are an index to our
condition. In 1872 we exported merchandise to the value of
$522,000,000; in 1898 the amount had swelled to $1,230,000,000,
an increase of two hundred and thirty-five per cent. No European
nation has shown such progress. Despite their colonial empires,
their armies and navies, their chartered companies, their spheres of
influence, and all their elaborate paraphernalia, we are competing
with them in their own markets. We have pursued a policy the opposite
of theirs and are outstripping them in the race for a share of
the world's trade. It is not compatible with industrial wisdom to
change and adopt the policy of our less successful rivals just as the
success of our own policy is being fully demonstrated.</p>

<p>A nation's commercial supremacy rests upon the same principles
as a business man's leadership in his trade&mdash;namely, superiority of
production. It does not require a citation of evidence to say that the
producers of Europe are staggering under the burden of their armies
and navies. While they are thus handicapped, we have nothing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
fear unless we inflict upon ourselves a similar burden. We have
succeeded by attending to our own industries, by developing our
natural resources, by producing things that the people of other nations
must have. That development is but begun. Even England,
the ruler of the greatest colonial empire the world has ever known,
the greatest manufacturing nation, the mistress of the seas, stands
with almost stationary exports. The United States, the nation with
a small navy, the nation that never really had a colony, the so-called
isolated nation, has come by rapid strides to the point where she is the
leading exporter of the world.</p>

<p>There is no reason why the progress of the United States should
be checked. England has demonstrated the fact that the nation that
has the iron and coal is the commercial mistress of the world. The
United States is continuing, and will continue the demonstration.
England has but 900 square miles of much-used coal lands, and
she gets her iron ore from Spain. We have over 200,000 square
miles<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> of untouched coal lands; an almost continuous bed of iron
ore, reaching from Lake Ontario to Alabama.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> Beside this great
ore bed is the Appalachian coal field, with coal mines in every State
between New York and Alabama. There are mountains of iron ore
in Missouri and Michigan. By the special lines of lake steamers the
iron ore of Lake Superior is taken to Chicago and Cleveland, and
thence carried by rail to Pittsburg. There the eastern coal completes
the conditions for the most economical production of iron and
steel. That gives the United States the basis for our export trade
in iron, steel, and machinery. We are capturing the iron markets
of the world, and, judging by our supplies, can hold them for ages.
As our iron and coal are the basis of all manufacturing industry,
continued attention to them will give us the control of the world's
trade.</p>

<p>There are many other lines of our internal development that
are yet barely begun. Irrigation is an example of this. The report
of John W. Noble, Secretary of the Interior for 1891, said, "One hundred
and twenty million acres that are now desert may be redeemed
by irrigation so as to produce the cereals, fruits, and garden products
possible in the climate where the lands are located." That is an
area nearly twice as large as the Philippine Islands, and it is open
to the American settler, while there is an indication that the Philippines
may be inaccessible on account of their climate. Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
they are four times as densely populated as is the United States; and
while we deem the Chinese so undesirable that we exclude him from
our shores, all authorities agree that his race is superior to that of
the Malays, Tagals, and Negritos who inhabit the Philippines.</p>

<p>The irrigable area is much larger than the States of New York,
Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Massachusetts combined. Those States
at the present time are supporting a population of over seventeen
millions, and many authorities claim that they will in the future
support at least fifty millions. The regions of scanty rainfall that
can be irrigated are fairly crusted with potash and other soluble
mineral ingredients that nourish plant life, and give to the valleys
already irrigated their astonishing fertility. This enables the
farmers to support themselves on such small areas that the life is
almost a communal one. The irrigated West can sustain a population
as great as that sustained on an equal area in the East, or even
greater.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> For years that dry climate has been a health restorer to
the sojourner there. This is not claimed for the Philippine Islands.
The building up of this Western empire with its canals and irrigating
ditches, its railroads and cities, will absorb a vast amount of capital,
and it is a natural and easy line of development for us. Mr. Irwin
has said, "To capital seeking investment in a large way, irrigation
enterprises in the West offer a most solid, lucrative, and tempting
field."<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> Secretary Noble has said, "No one can now compute the
money value that will concentrate in these reservoirs and canals and
ditches, carrying water to the fields of the husbandman, and upon
which the people must depend for their prosperity."<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>Five centuries ago large parts of eastern and western England
were impenetrable morasses. These have entirely disappeared before
the skill of the engineer.</p>

<p>N. S. Shaler says, "The total area of the inundated lands of
the United States probably exceeds 115,000 square miles, counting
only those flooded areas which are at present unsuited by their excessive
humidity for agricultural use, but which may be won to
the service by engineering devices such as have been applied in the
regions occupied by older civilizations."<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> This is more than 73,000,000
acres of drainable swamps and marshes. Lands more easy
of access have, in the past, so occupied our attention that these lowlands
have thus far been almost entirely neglected. They are located<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
along our northern, eastern, and southern borders in close proximity
to water transportation and to the large cities of the seaboard. They
can be drained, as were the swamps of England. Their fertility will
make this profitable, and they will support a large population.</p>

<p>The public highways of the United States are, on the whole, in
anything but a desirable condition, and their improvement is a good
investment for the commonwealth. We have railroads to build,
harbors to deepen, and canals to dig. The United States is young
yet, and tremendous tasks await her labor and capital.</p>

<p>In this country, so full of promise for the future, we are still
using borrowed foreign capital. In The Forum for February, 1895,
Mr. Alfred S. Lauterbach said, "That the people of the United
States require European capital for the full development of the great
resources of our country there can be no doubt." The same author
made a "very conservative estimate," and said that we owed to
Europe annually:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="90%" summary="money owed to Europe annually">
<tr><td align="left">"For dividends and interest upon American securities still held abroad, minimum</td><td align="right">$75,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">"For profits of foreign corporations doing business here, and of non-residents, derived from real estate, investments, partnership profits, etc., about</td><td align="right">75,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="right">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="right">$150,000,000</td><td>"</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>That is to say, we were paying a five-per-cent interest on $3,000,000,000
of foreign money.</p>

<p>As to the second assumption: It is claimed by some that we
should have the Philippines because they will furnish us the tropical
products that we are using in ever-increasing quantities. Two things
are revealed in the examination of our needs of tropic products
and a comparison of the Philippines with the American tropics:
1. That the Philippines are at a great disadvantage in location.
2. That America is of sufficient area and natural wealth to meet
all our needs, and more.</p>

<p>As to location: It is a first principle of commerce to get supplies
where they are most accessible. It is about ten thousand miles
from New York to Manila, twelve hundred to Havana, and eighteen
hundred to the continent of South America. Under these conditions
the freight rates must always discriminate in favor of tropic America.
The disadvantage of the Philippines is increased by the fact that the
ships going from San Francisco or Panama to Manila are compelled
to carry their coal three thousand four hundred miles at one stretch&mdash;from
Honolulu to Yokohama, the most available route. Then,
again, a large part of our tropic trade, and one that shows promise
of the most growth, is in the green fruits, such as cocoanuts, pineapples,
lemons, oranges, and bananas. Of the last article our imports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
have doubled every five years since 1865. On account of distance
it is not practicable to bring any of these fruits from the
Philippines, but there is no limit to the amount of trade that can grow
up on the lines that are now beginning to form between us and our
southern neighbors.</p>

<p>As to the fitness of tropic America to supply our needs: There
are Central America, South America, and the West Indies. An
examination of their area and productiveness shows that there is
little to induce American industry to control any part of the Eastern
Hemisphere. Of the 17,000,000 square miles that make up the
Western Continent, the tropics make up 5,000,000 square miles&mdash;an
area sufficient to make more than one hundred States as large
as Pennsylvania; an area nearly fifty times as great as the Philippines.
The variety of its productions is scarcely excelled even by
the East Indies. There are only two important tropic products imported
into the United States that are not already largely produced on
this continent. They are Manila hemp and tea, and it would appear
that the reason they come from the East is because of present labor
conditions there. Manila hemp is a sort of half-wild product that
may yet have an introduction to our rich tropics just as the potato
was introduced into Europe, and many of our crops have been
introduced from Europe. Even the tea plant thrives in the warm
regions of America as far north as Tennessee. Small quantities
of tea are now grown in various parts of America,<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> but the cheap
labor of the East has made it unprofitable here. We are at the
present time getting nine tenths of our tea from India, where Anglo-Saxon
care has developed the industry and is fast driving China out
of the tea market of the world.</p>

<p>There is a difference when it comes to the two great tropic staples
of coffee and sugar. Our imports of these two articles in 1897 were
valued at $180,000,000, while the imports of tea were less than one
twelfth as much. At the present time nearly all the coffee used
in the United States comes from Central and South America, whence
also comes the greater part of the world's supply. The declining
price of coffee indicates that we shall get it under more favorable
terms in the future.</p>

<p>We import about $100,000,000 worth of sugar per annum.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a>
Approximately two fifths of it is beet sugar and comes from the continent
of Europe, and the rest is cane sugar from scattered sources
in the tropics. Only one sixth comes from the Eastern Hemisphere.
We are getting sugar from Europe, not because it is the natural
development of the industry, but because those countries are willing
to give an export bounty on all that is exported. This makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
exportation possible. Meanwhile the American sugar industry is
left to unprogressive and slovenly methods, but it needs only a reasonable
addition of capital and labor to enable it to supply the markets
of the world. An Englishman of much experience in the sugar-growing
colonies of Great Britain says that by the introduction of
improved methods all the sugar that we use in this country could
be grown on one half of the little island of Porto Rico.<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> This would
cause heavy complaint from the sugar-cane region of Louisiana, and
from those sections of our country that are beginning to hope for a
future in the beet-sugar industry. Certainly America can supply
herself in this particular.</p>

<p>India rubber is another of our tropic imports that promises to increase
in importance with improvements in our ability to use it.
Nearly the whole supply comes from the American tropics. There
it thrives everywhere. We are importing it from almost all of
our sister republics, and although it responds readily to cultivation
and yields a profitable crop,<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> the main supply is yet taken from the
wild trees of the forests. Like the other products it waits for the
capital which it will well repay.</p>

<p>By a comparison of the average yields per acre of the leading
tropic imports with the amounts of those imports, we shall find the
area of the territories that are in cultivation to meet our present
needs.<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> In 1897 we imported into this country from all sources the
crops that would be yielded by 1,400 square miles of coffee, 30 of
bananas, 40 of cocoa beans, 60 of India rubber, 10 of oranges; a
total of 1,540 square miles. Add to that the area that will be needed
for our sugar, and the result does not equal the whole of Porto
Rico. The area of Porto Rico is less than 4,000 square miles. Multiply
these crop areas by ten, to make allowance for crop rotation
and for the time taken for new plantations to come into bearing.
The result will be less than 40,000 square miles, a territory not
half as great as the area of the West India islands. They in
their turn do not comprise the fiftieth part of the area of tropic
America.</p>

<p>When the time comes that American industry needs to develop
more lands, there they lie. They are our opportunity. They have
an almost virgin soil, because we have been too busy with our own
internal development to give them needed attention. They need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
capital, and we have been borrowing money abroad to meet our needs
at home. Their inhabitants are idle for lack of employment; they
will respond to our capital. The United States is the natural market
for the West Indies; they lie close to our shores, and when the Nicaragua
Canal comes they will be but islands in an American lake&mdash;parts
of the industrial unit of Greater America. They can give us
the things that are needed to round out our consumption, and we can
do the same for them.</p>

<p>It is illogical and unlike American shrewdness to go seven thousand
miles for tropic lands when an equally valuable, a more valuable,
area is within seven hundred miles of us. The comparison becomes
even more striking when it is remembered that the control of
the Philippines brings to us a burden of problems from which industrial
development in this country is free.</p>

<p>The Government at Washington may spend our millions and
establish government in the Philippines, but will American capital
go there? Will our citizens invest their money seven thousand miles
away while tropic America is so much nearer, and is, moreover, an
equally rich and far more extended field? This does not assume the
conquest of American regions. It is not necessary to have governmental
control in order to profit by the industries of a country. The
conditions of modern industry prove this most conclusively. But for
this fact the progress of the world would have been much less rapid.
We have an example of this in American railroads: they have been
largely built by English capital; the same is also true to a greater
or less degree of many of our other industries. What England has
done in North America without governmental control, we can do in
Central and South America when our industrial condition demands
new areas to work over. By the modernized Monroe doctrine our
supremacy in this hemisphere is assured, and we have the guarantee
of a clear field. Our interests are also furthered by our
friendly relations with the American peoples and by our nearness
to them.</p>

<p>The American policy of our forefathers is the one for us, even
from the industrial point of view. America is an industrial unit,
an economic unit, full of undeveloped possibilities that await the
hand of American enterprise. Our resources can abundantly provide
for our material needs. The continent is controlled by the
most ingenious of all the races, and is dominated by the highest political
ideals known to man. What need have we to reach out across
seven thousand miles of ocean to take lands populous with millions
of barbarians?</p>

<h2>THE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE WEST INDIES.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By F. L. OSWALD.</span></p>


<h3>III.&mdash;REPTILES AND FISHES.</h3>

<p>The present fauna of our planet includes many varieties of mammals
and reptiles, and a few kinds of birds, that are found only
on certain islands&mdash;a fact which seemed rather to justify the once
universal belief in the origin of species by separate acts of creation.</p>

<p>A different theory of explanation has, however, been suggested
by the discovery of fossil remains, proving the former existence of
closely allied forms on continents where their battle for existence had
to be fought against beasts of prey and competitors for a limited food
supply.</p>

<p>The supposed products of an island genesis by the fiat of supernatural
agencies, demanding recognition in mental penance and the
payment of tithes, may thus be simply animal Crusoes, favored by
the positive or negative advantages of their surroundings.</p>

<p>The dodo, in its struggle for survival, would have had no chance
against South American tiger-cats. Not one of the twenty-odd
species of Madagascar lemurs could have held its own against the competition
of the African daylight monkeys.</p>

<p>Yet there was a time when night apes and large ground birds seem
to have had things all their own way, the world over, and Central
America may have afforded a chance for existence to several species
of reptiles which at present are found only on the West Indian
islands.</p>

<p>The Cuban bush tortoise (<i>Emys nigra</i>) is found only in the
forests of Santiago and Puerto Principe, and there only on the south
coasts. It is the most sluggish creature of its genus, and does not
seem to have had enterprise enough to crawl around the sand belt of
Cape Maysi and colonize the jungles of the north side provinces. It
is as helpless as a hedgehog, <i>minus</i> its bristles. The darkeys of the
Cuban planters crack its armor with home-made hammers, and the
<i>tortuga prieta</i>, or prieta, as they call it for short, forms a factor of
holiday <i>menus</i> as frequently as 'possum pie in southern Georgia.</p>

<p>Swift-flowing rivers bear it away as they would a floating log,
and it is wholly incredible that its ancestors should have crossed the
Caribbean Sea in quest of a more congenial home; but it is possible
enough that its eggs may have been ferried across on one of the
driftwood islands which the Sumasinta River often tears from the
coast swamps of southern Mexico and carries into the current of the
Gulf Stream. The evolution of the South American giant cats was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
probably the death warrant of its continental relatives, but in Cuba
it had no four-footed enemies except the <i>hutia</i>, or jungle rat, that now
and then destroys its eggs.</p>

<p>An equally favored islander is the grayish-yellow rock lizard,
abounding in the uplands of Cuba and Hayti. The lizard-killing
cranes of Honduras
have not found their
way to the Antilles,
and the <i>lagartilla</i> still
basks in the sun that
once smiled upon the
indolence of the naked
Lucayans.</p>

<p>The <i>toco</i>, or Cuban
hornbill, however,
devours small
reptiles of all sorts,
and the West Indian
tree lizards have
become almost as
nimble as squirrels.
They dodge behind
branches and wait to
ascertain the origin
of every flitting shadow,
but from imminent danger save themselves by a swift descent,
followed by a bold leap into the thickets of the underbrush. Their
courtship is quite as grotesque as that of the strutting bush pheasants.
The males will swing their heads up and down and puff up
their throat-bags till their skin seems on the point of disruption,
while the objects of their rivalry sit blinking, reluctant to risk an
open manifestation of preference. Some gorgeously beautiful varieties
are found in Jamaica: greenish-blue, with a metallic luster,
and rows of bright crimson spots, as if the design of protective
colors had been patterned after the flower shrubs of the tropics.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illo_054_iguana.jpg" width="400" height="430" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Iguana.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The word <i>iguana</i> is of Mexican origin, and rarely used in the
Spanish West Indies, but the animal itself is&mdash;for culinary purposes,
though the Haytian negroes do not go quite as far as the mongrels of
Yucatan, where iguana farmers fatten the defenseless reptiles with
cornmeal, in wickerwork baskets, that are brought to market as a
New England poultry fancier would fetch in a crateful of spring
chickens. But, prejudice aside, there is no harm in an iguana
fricassee; the meat is white and insipid, but takes the flavor of every
spice, and is far more digestible than such hyperborean delicacies as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
fried eels and pork fritters. There are two species&mdash;one in eastern
Cuba, with spines all the way down to its tail-tip, and in Hayti a
smaller one, with a smoother tail, but with an exaggerated throat-bag
and wattles like a turkey gobbler.</p>

<p><i>Lagartos vastecos</i>, or "tree alligators," the Cuban creoles call the
scampering forest dwellers, that attain a length of four feet, and
can stampede foreigners by leaping to terra firma with an <i>aplomb</i>
that scatters the dry leaves in all directions. If chased, they will
take to water like frogs. They are first-class swimmers, their throat-bag
serving the purpose of a float, and once in the ripple of the
stream are hard to keep in sight, as they have a trick of keeping their
legs close to the body and navigating by means of their submerged
tails. Like the rainbow hues of the coryphene (miscalled dolphin),
the bright colors of the iguana soon fade after death, and the shriveled
greenish-brown specimens of our taxidermists give no idea of the
appearance of the living animal in the sunlight of its native land.
The <i>Iguana tuberculata</i> (eastern Cuba) is velvet-green above, with
saffron flanks, ringed with blue, black, and brown stripes, and the pet
specimens, basking on the porch of a coffee planter, can challenge
comparison with the paroquets that flutter about the eaves of the
outbuildings like swifts around a martin box.</p>

<p>Cuba has also acclimatized a horned frog, and one species of
those curious half-lizards whose shapes may have suggested the
dragon fables of antiquity. The "basilisk" (<i>Cyclura carinata</i>) is
only half a yard long, but can erect its crest and raise its pronged tail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
in a manner that will make a dog leap back in affright. It has no
goiter-bag, but the skin of its throat is elastic, and can be made to
swell out like that of the East Indian cobra, while its multiplex spines
vibrate ominously. The little monster is, nevertheless, one of the
most harmless reptiles of the tropics, and subsists on succulent leaves,
with occasional <i>entremets</i> of small grubs and insects. In that case,
however, Nature has rather overdone its efforts at protective ugliness,
and the creoles kill the poor simulator of terrors as the Mexican
rustics would a horned toad.</p>

<p>A plurality of the zo&ouml;logical immigrants of the West Indies seem
to have come from Mexico, and it is a suggestive fact that the number
of reptiles steadily decreases from west to east. Cuba, with its western
headland approaching the east coast of Yucatan, thus came in
for a lion's share of lizards, tortoises, and ophidians.</p>

<p>Hayti, though only one fourth smaller, experienced a seventy-five-per-cent
discount, and all natives and travelers agree on the
<i>curiosum</i> that there is <i>not a single species of serpent</i> on the island
of Porto Rico. Trinidad, with an area of only fifteen hundred
square miles, but laved by the giant current of the Orinoco, boasts
twenty-eight species of land serpents, besides several pythons and
swamp vipers. The Trinidad museum of venomous ophidians does
not, however, include the dreaded fer-de-lance, which infests the
woods near Samana Bay on the south coast of San Domingo. The
<i>Bothrops lanceolatus</i> is larger than a rattlesnake, and its bite, though
not always fatal, causes fearful inflammation, but its aggressive disposition
has been greatly exaggerated. Like most venomous serpents,
it is a sluggish brute, relying on its ability to crouch motionless
till its prey comes in range, then get in a snap bite and shrink
back to wait till the virus begins to take effect, and the victim, in
its fever spasms, betrays its helplessness by those eccentricities of conduct
which are apt to be misinterpreted by the dupes of the "serpent-charm"
superstition.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illo_055_fer.jpg" width="500" height="433" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fer-de-Lance.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The fer-de-lance is found also on the islands of Martinique and
Santa Lucia, where the natives counteract its virus with a decoction
of jungle hemlock, and the basis of its grewsome reputation seems to
be the fact that it does not warn the intruders of its haunts, after
the manner of the cobra or the rattlesnake, but flattens its coils and,
with slightly vibrating tail, awaits events. If the unsuspecting
traveler should show no sign of hostile intent he may be allowed to
pass unharmed within two yards of the coiled matador, but a closer
approach is apt to be construed as a challenge, and the <i>vivoron</i>, suddenly
rearing its ugly head, may scare the trespasser into some motion
of self-defense&mdash;he may lift his foot or brandish his stick in a menacing
manner. If he does he is lost. The lower coils will expand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
bringing the business end, neck and all, a few feet nearer; the head
"points," like a leveled rifle, then darts forward with electric swiftness,
guided by an unerring instinct for the selection of the least-protected
parts of the body.</p>

<p>And the vindictive brute is ready to repeat its bite. For a
moment it rears back, trembling with excitement, and, if felled by
a blow of its victim's stick, will snap away savagely at stumps and
stones, or even, like a wounded panther, at its own body.</p>

<p>A very curious adaptation of means to ends in the modification of
the virus is its swiftly fatal effect on birds. A stricken child, though
half crazed with fear, may run a distance of three miles before paralysis
begins to impede its motions; a squirrel will escape to its nest
in the top of the tree, only to come forth again and topple down
in its delirium; but a bird drops as if he had swallowed a dose of
prussic acid. Serpent virus is specifically a bird poison; in other
words, it acts instantaneously in cases where a few moments' delay
would defeat the purpose of the snap bite. Wounded rodents will
not run very far and can be relied upon to come out of their holes;
but a bitten bird, unless promptly paralyzed, would fly out of sight
and drop in distant thickets, beyond the ken of its destroyer. And of
all bird-killing reptiles the fer-de-lance is the most destructive. The
Spaniards have varied its bill of fare by importing the wherewithal
of an occasional rabbit stew, but during the preceding ages it had to
subsist on poultry, like a popular circuit preacher&mdash;the <i>hutia</i> rat
having developed a talent for avoiding its haunts.</p>

<p>The alleged <i>horror naturalis</i> of serpents is perhaps not more
deep-rooted than the aversion to cats; at all events, the West Indians
have overcome it sufficiently to prefer rat-killing snakes to tabbies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
In thousands of rancho cabins a pet serpent of the genus <i>coluber</i> may
be seen gliding noiselessly along the rafters, or slip through the
crack of a floor plank to reach the penetralia of the basement, where
the death shriek of rodents soon after announces the result of its
activity. Aristocratic Creoles relegate it to their stables, but the
tenants of numerous backwood <i>casuchas</i> furnish it a cotton-stuffed
bed box, and reward its services with a weekly dish of milk. There
are several species of large river serpents, and one true boa, the Cuban
<i>matapollos</i>, or chicken-killer, that attains a length of eighteen feet,
and has been known to use its supernumerary coils for the purpose
of cracking the ribs of a hound flying to the assistance of the barnyard
rooster.</p>

<p>In addition to the above-mentioned jungle tortoise there are
several land turtles of the genus <i>chlemmys</i>, and thousands of chelidonians
are annually caught on Samana Bay, southern Porto Rico,
St. Vincent, the Isle of Pines, and the north coast of Matanzas, Cuba.
Those of Santiago Bay have gradually been exterminated, but a
large number of West Indian fishing waters are practically inexhaustible.
A specialist like Agassiz might haul nondescripts from
scores of Haytian coast rivers, and the angle fishers of the Cuban
sierra brooks can hook an equally interesting reproduction of an
Appalachian species.</p>

<p>"Some of our companions had to eke out a haul with crawfish,"
says the traveler Esterman, "but our own string of sundries included
a puzzle for naturalists. We had caught some twenty brook trout,
absolutely indistinguishable from the species found in the head waters
of the Tennessee River. Where did they come from? Had they
crossed the Gulf of Mexico and ascended the rapids of half a hundred
rivers, or had Nature copied her own handiwork in such details as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the small dark dots below each red spot, and the occasional breaks in
the lines of the silver-white keel streaks?"</p>

<p>The perch of the forest rivers include several nest-building varieties,
and the sportsmen of Kingston, Jamaica, often amuse themselves
with target practice at a species of rock fish that come clear out
of the water and bask, like coots, on the harbor cliffs.</p>

<p>With every mile farther south the number and variety of the
finned aborigines become more infinite, and the fishermen of the
estuary of San Juan de Porto Rico alone catch pompanos, mullets,
cavalli, red snappers, chiquillos (a kind of sardelles), sea bass, dorados,
skip-jack, angelfish, skate, ray, sheepshead, garfish, torpedo-fish, devilfish
or giant ray, cobia, hogfish, croakers, shark, and coryphenes.</p>

<p>The tiger of the sea, the great white shark, occasionally visits
the harbor waters of Cuba, and has been known to seize barefooted
peons, surf-bathing horses in the next neighborhood of Morro Castle,
and drag them under so suddenly that their companions were unable
to account for their disappearance till the foam of the breakers became
flecked with blood.</p>

<p>That champion of marine man-eaters is as smooth as a hypocrite,
and hides its double row of horrible fangs under a slippery nose, while
the little butterfly fish tries its best to disguise its helplessness with a
crest of spiny fins. Its length rarely exceeds four inches, and it can
be handled with impunity, but its spines are just rigid enough to entangle
it in tufts of gulf weed, and in company of equally tiny sea
horses and goldfish, it can often be seen in the aquariums of the
Jamaica seaport towns.</p>

<h2>A STUDY OF LUIGI LUCCHENI (ASSASSIN OF THE EMPRESS OF AUSTRIA).</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By CESARE LOMBROSO.</span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illo_060_fig1.jpg" width="400" height="526" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.&mdash;Luigi Luccheni.</span></span>
</div>

<p>There is not an enlightened person in the world who does not
deplore the anarchist crime committed last summer by Luccheni
in Geneva upon the unfortunate Empress of Austria. With
grief is associated the duty of inquiring what could have been the origin
of a misdeed which besides being cruel had the vice of being absurd,
falling as it did upon a poor woman near the tomb, who was
ready to welcome death, and who had no political influence, by an
assassin who had not suffered any offense from her or from her government,
and who further had the impudence to boast of his crime
as if it had been a heroic act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>We begin our inquiry by seeking for an explanation of the act
by means of a study of the person of the murderer in conformity
with the rules of the anthropological school.</p>

<p>Luigi Luccheni is the illegitimate son of a Parmesan servant now
living in America, and her master, who lived in the Parmesan territory,
a priest, unbalanced and intemperate, who sent her when she
was pregnant to Paris to be confined. There she abandoned her
newborn babe to a foundling asylum. The child was sent thence
to his native country and
placed, till he was nine
years old, with a Parmesan
family named Monici, of
whom the father was a
shoemaker, very poor and
intemperate, and the mother
immoral.</p>

<p>After he was nine years
old he was put with a family
named Nicasi, good people,
but very poor&mdash;peasants,
or rather mendicants,
so that he too became a
mendicant, wandering with
his comrades through the
streets and pilfering till he
was thirteen years old. It
appears from what Dr.
Guerini, of Parma, writes
me that during this time
he had epileptic fits. When twelve years old he went to school,
where he appeared bright but impulsive, and on one occasion in his
anger destroyed the portrait of the king.</p>

<p>From the age of fourteen to that of nineteen he was a servant,
and had two masters, and wandered in Liguria, Switzerland, and
Austria, where he was arrested, sent back to his country, and prohibited
from showing himself in the east. He then entered the
military service, where he conducted himself very well, incurring
only light punishments for assaulting a comrade and for helping a
sergeant get out of the barracks at night. He was so liked by his
superiors and comrades that when, three years afterward, in 1897,
he left the army, Captain the Prince de Vera engaged him as his
servant. In this service he exhibited great affection for children, and,
what is strange, he was so good a monarchist that he was scandalized
that at the commemoration of the deceased Cavolotti, in Naples, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
orator was permitted to praise him as a political man without interruption
from the delegate.</p>

<p>One day, irritated because he had been denied some permission,
he abruptly took his leave, declaring that he was not born to be a
servant, and returned to Switzerland to work as a marble polisher.
But even from Switzerland he kept continually imploring his old
employer to take him back, declaring in a letter which revealed
symptoms of a persistent delirium that "he probably would not receive
him again because he did not go to mass"; which indicates
substantially that he had not that repugnance for the anti-anarchical
life of a servant which he manifested previously and afterward.<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></p>

<p>Whether all at once or not he became an extreme anarchist. He
signed and composed anarchist hymns. Suspected by his comrades of
not being zealous enough, and also perhaps of being a spy, he decided
to strike a blow against some prince; he chose the empress as his victim
possibly because he had suffered his first annoyance in Austria. He,
who had never killed a fly, had a rude instrument prepared&mdash;a file;
practiced for a considerable time, perhaps a month, at striking with
it, and having committed the crime, tried to escape. When stopped
by two citizens he did not resist, and behaved in a very different way
from common criminals, therein exhibiting a tinge of insanity. He,
for example, although he knew French very well, denied it and demanded
an interpreter in the interrogations. He sang and laughed
continually, and was glad that he had dealt his victim a good blow,
and that he had struck deep with the instrument, boasting that he had
used a file instead of a dagger. He was, besides, solicitous of publicity,
declaring to the reporters and the judges that he had done the deed
all alone, that he had left his captain to accomplish his idea, that he
had been an anarchist for thirteen years, etc. In two ungrammatical
and very long letters to the journal <i>Don Marzio</i>, in Naples, chosen
evidently because he had seen it at his master's, he declared that he
was not a criminal born, as Lombroso would have it, nor a madman,
and that he had not been incited by misery but by conviction, because,
if all would do as he had done, middle-class society would soon
disappear. He knew that this single assassination would be of no
avail, but he had, nevertheless, committed it for an example.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illo_062_fig2.jpg" width="600" height="205" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.&mdash;Extract from a Letter by Luccheni.</span></span>
</div>

<p>He wrote to the President of the Swiss Confederation that he
would rather be tried at Lucerne, because the death penalty was in
force there, and repeated the statement to the judges; he wrote to
his master that he was more worthy of him than ever; he replied to
the reporters and the judges who reproached him with having killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
a helpless woman, that as for that, if she had been a child, but a
prince, he would have killed her all the same. At another time he
said, in a wild way: "I killed her because she did not work; whoever
does not work should not eat, and I was not going to work
for her"&mdash;a reason which would be as good for the slaughter of several
million persons.</p>

<p>Curious and important is the remark of Luccheni that "Crispi
would not have killed her because he was a thief"; an evident proof
of the complete lack of moral sense in anarchists,<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> who like primitive
men confound the crime with the deed, and regard criminality as a
sort of merit, a seal of fraternity; which demonstrates that the anarchistic
practice, if not its theory, is an equivalence of crimes.</p>

<p>When asked if he had never committed blood-crimes, he replied
that he had never had anything to do with courts, not even as a
witness&mdash;which was found to be true&mdash;but "I entertained the idea
this time, and acted upon it."</p>

<p>Luccheni is a man of medium stature, about 1.63 metre, with
very thick, light chestnut hair, stout, with dark-gray, half-closed eyes,
roundish ears, heavy eyebrows, voluminous cheek bones and jaw
prognatic, low forehead, very brachycephalic (cephalic index 88). He
has, therefore, a number of characteristics of degeneration common
to epileptics and insane criminals. On the other hand, his handwriting,
with its minute characters, especially in the writing of past
years, indicates a mild feminine disposition, with little energy of character.
This is especially seen in an autograph of 1896, which was
procured for me by Dr. Guerini, who got it from his patient (see
Fig. 2). This characteristic, which was extremely conspicuous in
Caserio when he was near his crime, was also apparent in the assailant
of General Rocha. I have likewise observed it to be very conspicuous
in epileptics and hysterical persons; and it corresponds, according as
they are in their psychical spasm or out of it, with a real double personality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
provoked by their disease. In one, as I have shown in
<i>L'Uomo Delinquente</i>, they write signatures that cover a whole page
in their larger diameter, while the signature in the normal state is
often smaller than the average (see Fig. 3).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illo_065_fig3.jpg" width="600" height="373" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.&mdash;Macrographic and Micrographic Writing by the same Epileptic.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The same double personality that is apparent in the writing is
attested in the psychology. We have seen that Luccheni was kind
to children, that he was a good servant, characteristics quite opposed
to the anarchistic nature, and a genial companion; a man who in
Africa was enthusiastically fond of military life; who, a little while
before, when he was in the service of the captain, had expressed extreme
monarchical sentiments; and finally, when he had become an
anarchist, again asked his master to be restored to his service. This
double personality is another of the essential characteristics of hysteria
and epilepsy.</p>

<p>I have recently studied an epileptoid degenerate who has a sound
mind, and, at least in his normal state, is quiet and gentle. But as
soon as he has taken hardly more than ninety grammes of alcohol (96&deg;
proof) he becomes a wild anarchist, with fierce impulses and hallucinations,
of which he has no recollection two hours afterward, or even
charges them to his comrades. In this case a double personality is
revealed, the demonstration of which is completed by alterations of
the visual field and of the touch.</p>

<p>We have, then, in Luccheni a degenerate and probably epileptic
person descended from an alcoholic father. Although he affirms that
he is not insane or a criminal born, he is a little of both, for he is
epileptic and hysterical, so that his denial is already a beginning of
a proof of disease. Luccheni also confirms what I have tried to
demonstrate in my <i>Delitto politico</i>&mdash;that the most frequent organic
cause of similar morbid impulses of a political character is hystero-epilepsy;
for not only do the declarations of some of his countrymen
point to epilepsy, and the characteristics of degeneration in the
skull confirm it, but his inheritance from an alcoholic father and
that impulsiveness and that double personality, which make him pass
from the gentlest of men to the cruelest, and which is reflected in
the macrography alternating with the micrography of the intervals
between the spasms, are accumulative evidence of it.</p>

<p>I have demonstrated the hysterical and epileptic basis in the anarchists
and regicides Felicot, Monges, and Caserio, and particularly
in a vagabond anarchist, full of cranial anomalies, who told me, when
I questioned him concerning political reforms, "Do not speak to me
of them, for as soon as I begin to think about them I am taken with
a vertigo and fall down"; so that it seems to me possible to establish
a psycho-epileptic equivalent in extreme political innovators, an
equivalent which is further manifest in their vanity, rising sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
to megalomania, in their intermittent geniality, and especially in
their great impulsiveness. There was also latent in Luccheni an indirect
disposition to suicide, which I have found in other political
criminals, like Oliva, Nobiling, and Passananti,<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> who, having conceived
a dislike for the king, made an attempt on his life; and especially
in Henry, who rejected the defense of his advocate and his
mother based on the insanity of his father, remarking that it was
the advocate's business to defend, his to die; and in that Roumanian
who was photographed in a portrait that I have reproduced, in the
act of committing suicide.<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> Luccheni, too, believed he would be
condemned to death, and was much disappointed when he learned
that there was no such penalty in the canton where he committed the
crime.</p>

<p>It may have been morbid vanity that prompted the exclamation
he was heard to make, "I wanted to kill some great person, so as to
get my name in the papers" (Gautier).</p>

<p>But while an organic, individual cause was good for a third in
Luccheni's crime, he was much more influenced by the atmosphere
in which he lived. An illegitimate child, left in one of those nurseries
which are real nests of crime and graver disorders, then consigned
to a very poor and not always moral family of mendicant
habits, having learned nothing except to beg and wander, he found
such modes of subsistence as he could (notice the uncertainty and
plurality of his occupations, indicating lack of assiduity&mdash;servant,
soldier, marble polisher, and in the beginning peasant); he found, we
might say, as the most constant condition the infelicity which radiated
around him from every quarter, and, reflecting the worst, urged
him to this way of suicide. We should recollect, too, what Frattini
said: "Was it hunger brought me to this?" and the anarchist whom
Hamon speaks of: "When I began to question the unfortunates of the
hospital, it had a frightful effect on me; I comprehended the need of
solidarity and became an anarchist"; and as another one said to the
same Hamon: "I became an anarchist when I saw my comrades
begging for work with their faces bathed in tears, and was indignant
over it." Caserio wept when he thought of the lot of his Lombard
companions in misery. These criminals by passion, by altruism,
are, as Burdeau wrote, veritable philanthropic assassins. They
kill recklessly for the love of men.</p>

<p>Epilepsy and hysteria in Luccheni are explained by his abrupt
passage from one condition to the other, and by the conversion of
factional passion in him into a criminal act. But there are epileptics
and criminals everywhere; yet persons thus disordered in Norway
and Sweden are not transformed into anarchists; nor in Switzerland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a><br /><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
and England, whither people resort from all parts of the world, and
where, when anarchy shows itself, it is like a meteor falling to the
earth from the extra-planetary regions&mdash;wholly isolated and opposed
to the world around it.</p>

<p>The most important cause of this transformation is the misery
that weighs upon our unfortunate country, evidence of which comes
in from every side even upon those who are not miserable themselves.
If even in the latest days Luccheni had been living comfortably, he
could not, with the excessively morbid altruism that dominated him,
have failed to feel this misery, which is so profound and general in
Italy.</p>

<p>Not much erudition is required to demonstrate the immense
economical embarrassment of Italy as contrasted with other countries
when it is known that we pay about five hundred times its
value for salt, that bread is growing dearer every day, and that the
amount consumed diminishes one tenth every year in these lands.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with justice that Scarfoglio said in explaining
the origin of anarchism, "A good fifth of the population of Italy are
still living in a savage state, dwelling in cabins that the Papuans
would not live in, accommodating themselves to a food which the
Shillooks would refuse, having a vision and an idea of the world not
much more ample than that of the Kaffirs, and running over the
land desiring and seeking servitude."</p>

<p>It may be added that it is because of this condition&mdash;that is, of
the defective civilization that results from it&mdash;that there is everywhere
a weakened revulsion and diminished horror at blood-crimes,
so that there are now sixty homicides for every one hundred thousand
inhabitants.</p>

<p>We may learn from this what the true remedies should be. The
idea of conquering anarchy by killing anarchists is not valid, because
every epileptic has another ready to take his place, because anarchistic
crimes are to a great extent simply indirect suicides, and because
anarchists think as little of their own lives as of the life of another.
It is rather necessary to change the direction of the disease by changing
the miserable conditions in which it originates.</p>

<p>Not for humanity, therefore, not for exalted social theories, but
in our direct interest, we ought to make a complete change. The
suppression of a dozen anarchists is like killing a thousand microbes
without disinfecting the surroundings that contain milliards of them;
it is that we should look, if we want to be better, to breaking up the
large estates, and ameliorating the conditions of agriculture and
operative industry, and this in the interest of the governing classes.</p>

<p>Typhus, cholera, and plague, it is true, attack chiefly the poor,
but from these the contagion extends also to the rich; and from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
unhealthy habitations in which the rich man permits beggars to crowd
and suffer, the miasm, as if in revenge, is propagated to marble
palaces.</p>

<p>That imbecile idea of some European nations, who, instead of
disinfecting the medium, find it better to put down the doctors who
propose remedies, can not make itself at home except among peoples
who are destined to perish.<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a>&mdash;<i>Translated for the Popular Science

<h2>TENDENCIES IN FRENCH LITERATURE.<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a><br />

<small>SUGGESTED BY PROFESSOR DOWDEN'S RECENT BOOK.</small></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By PELHAM EDGAR, Ph. D.</span></p>


<p>"To present Victor Hugo in a few pages is to carve a colossus on
a cherry stone." Thus Professor Dowden prefaces his ten admirable
pages on the great French poet; and with equal appropriateness
we might assign the phrase as a motto for the whole undertaking.
The subject is too vast to cope with adequately in the limits of a
slender volume, the tendencies too complex; and the appeal from
human interest, which since the days of Sainte-Beuve and Taine has
formed such an important element in scientific criticism, had to be
abandoned in favor of generalized views of literary conditions and
tendencies necessarily abstract or impersonal in character. Yet, despite
these evident restrictions which the requirements of his task imposed
upon him, Professor Dowden has produced a work of extraordinary
merit, a masterpiece indeed in its kind. If we were not assured
that everything which the eminent critic writes is its own sufficient
justification, we might be inclined to question the necessity of the
present volume, in view of the painstaking and conscientious treatise
that Mr. Saintsbury gave to the public some sixteen years ago, and
which has deservedly remained until the present time the most reliable
English text-book upon the subject of French literature. With
no desire to disparage Mr. Saintsbury's scholarly contribution, the
present work does in truth supply a need which the earlier book, in
spite of its abundant merit, failed to satisfy. It is not harsh criticism
to state that Mr. Saintsbury's volume, crammed as it is with a plethora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of dates and titles, is at best a compendium for convenient reference,
and consequently quite unreadable as a book. Professor Dowden,
on the other hand, has conquered the dry-as-dust problem with admirable
skill, and the charm of his diction and the easy sequence of
his ideas lead the reader insensibly on to the close of a delightful
volume. Nor is the book lacking in instructive value of a highly
reliable kind, for, in addition to an intimate knowledge of French
criticism, Professor Dowden is evidently familiar at first hand with
all the more important works of which he treats, and not infrequently
proffers fertile suggestions upon debated questions.</p>

<p>Having avowed, therefore, a genuine admiration of Professor
Dowden's book, will it be thought a graceless task if, with the proverbial
perversity of critics, I endeavor to point out here and there
questions of importance that may seem to have merited more attention
than the author was perhaps able to afford to them within his restricted
space?</p>

<p>The medi&aelig;val portion of Professor Dowden's book is valuable not
for its originality, but rather as the reflection of advanced modern
criticism in France. Therefore, in this brief review the medi&aelig;val
period may be neglected, and turning to the second book, which
deals with the sixteenth century, the first writer of capital importance
whom we encounter is Cl&eacute;ment Marot. The author has justly indicated
the decrepit conditions of poetry in Marot's youth in the degenerate
hands of the Rh&eacute;toriqueurs, and also the powerful attraction
which the allegorizing mania exercised on the poet's early work. His
later manner is justly emphasized, and his prowess in the lighter
familiar forms of verse; but it is only by inference that we apprehend
the comparative neglect of his work until the later classical
reaction restored him to favor. Professor Dowden, indeed, throughout
his book has hardly conveyed a proper idea of the reactionary
shocks by which French literature has invariably advanced. Thus
the Pl&eacute;iade, in the enthusiasm of their rupture with middle-age
traditions, were blind to the Renaissance elements in Marot's work,
and seeking as they did to elevate poetry to nobler themes and a
nobler manner, his easy familiar grace was distasteful to them.</p>

<p>Rabelais, of course, is another "colossus on a cherry stone," and
the purport of his message is epitomized in a few luminous sentences.
The elements of contrast in the man, and his full-blooded joy in
living, which was the sign-manual of the Renaissance upon him, are
indicated as follows: "Below his laughter lay wisdom; below his orgy
of grossness lay a noble ideality; below the extravagances of his imagination
lay the equilibrium of a spirit sane and strong. The life
that was in him was so abounding and exultant that it broke all dikes
and dams; and laughter for him needed no justification, it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
part of this abounding life. After the medi&aelig;val asceticism and the
intellectual bondage of scholasticism, life in Rabelais has its vast outbreak
and explosion; he would be no fragment of humanity, but a
complete man."</p>

<p>Proceeding to the Pl&eacute;iade, we find its doctrine admirably enunciated,
and one point of literary history is well brought out&mdash;namely,
that to the Pl&eacute;iade, and not to Malherbe alone, belongs the honor
of establishing the bases of classicism in France, the difference chiefly
residing in the fact that the programme of the Pl&eacute;iade was one of expansion
in matters of language and prosody, whereas it is precisely in
these points that Malherbe and Boileau are concerned with restrictive
refinements. Again Professor Dowden, following perhaps in the
wake of M. Bruneti&egrave;re, characterizes the conditions of the time as
being unfavorable to lyrical expansiveness. "Ronsard's genius was
lyrical and elegiac, but the tendencies of a time when the great affair
was the organization of social life, and as a consequence the limitation
of individual and personal passions, were not favorable to the development
of lyrical poetry." These words are ripe with suggestiveness,
and duly weighed, they afford the true solution of the oratorical and
impersonal character of French literature for two long centuries,
when the social <i>genres</i> in prose and poetry usurped dominion over the
national mind. With our eye then upon the social conditions in
France, the often-quoted words "Malherbe a tu&eacute; le lyrisme" mean
nothing more than that he struck a prostrate body.</p>

<p>Before turning from the sixteenth century it should perhaps be
observed that in discussing the comedy of that period the author
might have amplified his statement of Italian influences by at least
a reference to the <i>Commedia dell' Arte</i> which we find established
in France in 1576, with its traditional repertory of stock characters,
whose antiquity ascends to the venerable times of the early Latin
farces, and whose survival the work of Moli&egrave;re, nay, even of Beaumarchais,
will adequately attest. The last great figure that greets us
in the sixteenth century is Montaigne, and we feel a sense of disappointed
curiosity when he is relentlessly dismissed at the end of the
five pages to which he is entitled here. This singularly modern
doubter still smiles inscrutably at us through the misty centuries that
flow between us, and we would prefer to loiter with him by the way
rather than pass him with a curt nod of recognition. But Montaigne is
more important in the history of thought than in the history of literature,
so, crossing the threshold of the sixteenth century, we meet the
great lawgiver Malherbe, a Moses who really entered the promised
land. Professor Dowden is eminently just and appreciative in his
judgment of this pedantic and unsympathetic figure, estimating his
merits and impartially noting his defects without presuming in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
character as literary historian to stamp them as such. Malherbe undeniably
eliminated personality from poetry. Shall we regard this
as a defect? A century's masterpieces of objective art survive to
say us nay, and if the critic's personal sympathies sway him to the
side of lyric eloquence, the historian of literature observing without
prejudice judges without rancor. "The processes of Malherbe's art
were essentially oratorical; the lyrical cry is seldom audible in his
verse; it is the poetry of eloquence thrown into studied stanzas. But
the greater poetry of the seventeenth century in France, its odes,
its satires, its epistles, its noble dramatic scenes, and much of its
prose literature, are of the nature of oratory; and for the progress
of such poetry, and even of such prose, Malherbe prepared a
highway."</p>

<p>And now in the wake of Malherbe so thick do the great names
throng that I must perforce touch swiftly only on what seems to demand
amplification rather than dwell at length, as it would be much
less difficult to do, on the many admirable views the book contains.
And first as regards the literary significance of Ren&eacute; Descartes. Professor
Dowden places himself in accord with the customary views of
criticism in assigning to Descartes a preponderating influence on the
literary art of his century. "The spirit of Descartes's work was in
harmony with that of his time, and reacted upon literature. He
sought for general truths by the light of reason; he made clearness a
criterion of truth; he proclaimed man a spirit; he asserted the freedom
of the will. The art of the classical period sought also for general
truths, and subordinated imagination to reason. It turned away
from ingenuities, obscurities, mysteries; it was essentially spiritualist;
it represented the crises and heroic victories of the will." This sounds
reasonable, and is indeed in large measure in accordance with the
actual conditions observable in the seventeenth century. Yet there
is no doubt that the literature of Louis XIV is more intimately penetrated
by the ascetic spirit of Jansenism as conveyed in the famous
doctrines of Port-Royal, and it is to Jansenism, and emphatically not
to Cartesianism, that the literature of the seventeenth century owes
that aspect of grandeur and moral serenity which characterizes it.
To quote Bruneti&egrave;re: "Pendant plus de cinquante ans, la conscience
fran&ccedil;aise, si l'on peut ainsi dire, incarn&eacute;e dans le jans&eacute;nisme, et
rendue par lui &agrave; elle-m&ecirc;me, a fait contre la frivolit&eacute; naturelle de la
race le plus grand effort qu'elle eut fait depuis les premiers temps de
la r&eacute;forme ou du calvinisme." Indeed, the tenaciously religious Jansenist
spirit of the "grand si&egrave;cle" would have been universal were it
not that Moli&egrave;re and La Fontaine were apathetically indifferent, nay,
sometimes actively hostile, to the general enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Let us, however, examine in all brevity the fundamental doctrines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
of Cartesianism. The terms are familiar enough. The identity of
being and of thought. The objectivity of science. The all-powerfulness
of reason. Progress to infinity. Optimism at all times. We
can not fail to observe the significance of these categories, and how
they contain the germs of almost every great subject debated by the
leviathians of the eighteenth century. Yet the nation struggled long
before it had strength to shake the incubus of Jansenism from its
back, and the stimulating work of Bayle had to be supported by
events of actual political significance before the stringent and constraining
dogmas of catholicism relaxed their grasp on thought and
conduct. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the Quietistic movement
with its unseemly attendant episcopal quarrels, and finally the
actual persecution of the Jansenists, all pointed inevitably in one
direction, and stimulating the anti-religious sentiment and opening
the flood gates to immorality, induced a potent reaction of Cartesianism
in the fundamental theories of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>In his treatment of Corneille, Professor Dowden "opens his hands
only sufficiently to let out a portion of the truth he holds," but what
he says is admirable to a degree. Of his diction he writes: "His
mastery in verse of a masculine eloquence is unsurpassed; his dialogue
of rapid statement and swift reply is like a combat with Roman short
swords; in memorable single lines he explodes, as it were, a vast charge
of latent energy, and effects a clearance for the progress of his action."
This is well said, but hardly indicates how Corneille soared so often
in the region of Spanish bombast, or crept among the insipid flowers
of Italian preciosity; defects from which Racine's severer Greek taste
held him free.</p>

<p>It is refreshing when we come to Boileau to find an English mind
impartial enough to do justice to the much-abused "lawgiver of
Parnassus." Criticism has for so long deplored his narrowness that
we relish an encomium on his good sense. But beyond this there is
an opinion which the general reader would be reluctant to admit, but
which Professor Dowden has had the courage and the discernment to
enforce, when he writes as follows: "But for Paris itself, its various
aspects, its life, its types, its manners, he had the eye and the precise
rendering of a realist in art; his faithful objective touch is like that
of a Dutch painter." Let the incredulous merely turn to the satires
to appreciate the scope and truth of the remark. It is difficult to
imagine that a more brilliant and effective account of Boileau's work
and influence could be presented within so limited a space; yet might
not the author have added that whereas Malherbe is the representative
of the aristocratic element in literature, Boileau is the first great
incarnation in modern times of the bourgeois spirit?</p>

<p>With regard to La Fontaine it need only be observed that Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Dowden recognizes what French critics with repeated insistence
emphasize, the cunning harmonies of his verse.</p>

<p>Much space is of right devoted to Moli&egrave;re, who with La Fontaine
has ever been a stumbling-block to English criticism. Professor
Dowden voices our national feeling in refusing to consider him as a
poet, preferring to emphasize his profound and healthy philosophy
of life. <i>Tartufe</i> he considers to be an attack on religious hypocrisy
merely. Is not the interpretation perhaps correct which regards it
as an attack on the intolerance and Puritanism of all religion, even
the most sincere?</p>

<p>Once again, in dealing with Racine, the author shows that subtle
discernment in which his criticism abounds. He penetrates to the
heart of the secret reason for the cabals that harassed Racine in the
later years of his dramatic activity, and which doubtless had their
influence in enforcing his retirement. Have we ever sufficiently
realized that Boileau, Moli&egrave;re, and Racine were waging constant
war against a rebirth of the <i>pr&eacute;cieux</i> spirit which threatened not
only society with ridiculousness but literature with ruin? Such, indeed,
was the case, and in the eyes of the super-refined coterie that
grouped itself round the Duchesse de Bouillon, Boileau and his fellow-workers
were innovators of a dangerous and revolutionary order.
Does not this idea carry us far from our preconceived notions of the
narrow conservatism that dominated the leaders of classical thought?
Referring to the disastrous check of Racine's <i>Ph&egrave;dre</i>, the author
writes: "It is commonly said that Racine wrote in the conventional
and courtly taste of his own day. In reality his presentation of tragic
passions in their terror and their truth shocked the aristocratic proprieties
which were the mode. He was an innovator, and his audacity
at once conquered and repelled." The point of view may seem
extreme to us, and this vaunted realism may show pale and weakly
when contrasted with the grossness of much of the realism that prevails
at the present day, or with the graphic directness of the best examples
of the type. But the words ring true if we are willing to
accept the refined psychological realism of Racine as equally worthy
to the title with the physiological naturalism of our more scientific
age. Our whole conception of Racine's art falls into line with this
view, and his constant solicitude for an easy and natural intrigue in
the structure of his tragedies may be brought home to the same healthy
impulse of his mind. Was it not Faguet who maintained that so
natural indeed were the processes of his plots that a happy ending
would have alone been needed to make any of his tragedies, with some
added modicum of wit, in all essential features a comedy that
Moli&egrave;re might have penned? Mr. Saintsbury, on the other hand,
in dealing with Racine is seemingly swayed by some innate prejudice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
or he could hardly have denied the poet a high moral character,
merely granting him the possession of great shrewdness and discernment.
True passion, he remarks, was not popular with the crowd,
but "love-making, on the contrary, would draw, and love-making
accordingly is the staple of all his plays." It is against this view, and
against Mr. Saintsbury's further opinion that the tragedy of Racine
is at the furthest remove from an imitation of Nature, that Professor
Dowden makes a strong and timely protest.</p>

<p>While applauding, however, the value of such novel opinions in
English criticism at least, we may suspect that in his desire to clinch
his arguments the author may have driven the nail too ruthlessly
home. And so it would appear when we seek in vain for any statement
which contains the shadow of a justification for the existence
of that powerful <i>pr&eacute;cieux</i> spirit against which the greater classicists
rebelled. We are too inclined to take Moli&egrave;re's word for it that they
were solely ridiculous, forgetting the explicit reserve of his preface&mdash;"aussi
les v&eacute;ritables pr&eacute;cieuses auraient tort de se piquer lorsqu'on
joue les ridicules qui les imitent mal." So let us then give the <i>Pr&eacute;cieuses</i>
credit for what they did confer to the advantage of letters
amid so much folly, and, weighing the matter carefully, their gift
to literature amounts to this: First, amid much linguistic and metaphorical
pedantry they were free from the equally damaging and
ridiculous pedantry of a labored erudition which pervaded the literature
of the day. In the second place, whether we regard it as an
advantage or the contrary, their influence made directly <i>against</i> the
licentiousness of the <i>esprit gaulois</i>, and <i>for</i> politeness and decency in
expression; and as a third count in their favor can we doubt that
straining as they did to express the <i>nuances</i> of sentiment and gallantry,
they were instrumental in stimulating that ardor of mental analysis
which is of all things the distinguishing mark of the century? A
word finally might have been said with a view to elucidating the inherent
divergence of the <i>pr&eacute;cieux</i> spirit from our own Euphuism,
from the Marinism of Italy, or the Gongorism of Spain; a divergence
due certainly to the fact that the <i>pr&eacute;cieuses</i> allied themselves to, and
accordingly strengthened, that spirit of social coherence so characteristic
of the life and letters of the time in France, whereas the influences
of similar movements abroad were more transitory, inasmuch as
in some degree more isolated and tentative.</p>

<p>The chapter devoted to the seventeenth century closes with a
critical review of the series of great preachers and theologians who
have left their mark more or less upon the development of thought,
while their literary significance can be comparatively slighted in a
history of this kind; and the chapter which discusses the transition to
the eighteenth century broaches questions of such large issue that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
an exhaustive treatment of them was not to be expected. Such are
the memorable quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns, and the
<i>philosophe</i> idea of perfectibility and human progress. The chapter
closes with an account of the great protagonist and pioneer in the
warfare against Christianity, the patient, plodding, dangerous Pierre
Bayle. So effectually was his teaching absorbed by Voltaire and the
encyclopedists that he is read no longer; but low as his flame has
sunk, he remains one of the beacons lighting us over the lurid
threshold of the century of strife.</p>

<p>We are in safe hands when it is Professor Dowden who guides us
on the highways and bypaths of the eighteenth century, but by very
reason of his accurate knowledge of the ground whereon he treads we
are disappointed when he fails to point out to us some special feature
of the landscape. Beauties we could hardly hope to meet with on our
journey. There was not sap enough in that arid soil to nourish
flowers, or send a flush of living green over hill and valley. The
most serious omission is to have left entirely out of account the exceedingly
interesting reactionary influences that leaped back and forth
across the Channel when Marivaux's romances were devoured in England,
and Richardson's <i>Pamela</i> was in every French pocket large
enough to hold it. It is in itself still an open question which of these
two authors exerted the initial influence on the other, although
eighteenth-century criticism invariably held that in <i>Marianne</i> Richardson
found his inspiration.</p>

<p>A great deal of interest attaches to an explanation of the causes
of Le Sage's decline in popularity, and this question likewise Professor
Dowden has not adequately presented. Le Sage saw the imperative
need of mediating between the stilted heroic romances <i>&agrave; la
Scud&eacute;ry</i> and the grotesque travesties of Scarron and Fureti&egrave;re. Inspired
by the picaroon romances of Spain, he produced, amid much
inferior work, <i>Gil Blas</i>, a masterpiece in its kind. The plot is loose-jointed,
the composition <i>nil</i>, but the book teems with such verve and
vigor that it still pulses with an abounding life when Marivaux and
Richardson slumber on our shelves. Yet we must admit that the
characters are vagabonds, and the sentiment not without coarseness.
Love when not slighted is ridiculed, and metaphysical analysis and
moral disquisitions are both refreshingly absent from the book.
Hence Le Sage's claims on our consideration as the progenitor of
naturalism in romance, but on this account also the reactionary wave
against which he had to buffet in his declining years. Marivaux, on
the other hand, saw the need of mediating between the stilted heroics
of Scud&eacute;ry and what he deemed the ignoble realism of Le Sage. In
this resolve he elevated the characters to <i>bourgeois</i> rank, and abandoning
the empty love rhetoric of the old romances, he brought the acuteness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
of an analytic mind to bear on the exploitation of the tender
passion; and a conscientious though desultory effort is made to study
subtle phases of character in the light of surrounding circumstances.
Despite the artificial <i>pr&eacute;cieuse</i> qualities of his style, and the unfinished
condition of his novels, Marivaux enjoyed an extraordinary
popularity in his day. The same problem repeats itself on a larger
scale when we transfer our attention to Richardson, whose works,
translated and popularized by Pr&eacute;vost, were read with the greatest
avidity in France. Were not these such influences as Professor
Dowden's profound knowledge of English literature would have
qualified him to illustrate with more precision than has yet been
brought to bear upon them; and was it not in point of fact almost
imperative for him to deal seriously with such an important theme
in the international literary history of nations?</p>

<p>The pages which Professor Dowden devotes to Voltaire, although
brilliant, are not sufficiently suggestive of the extraordinary influence
which that most celebrated of writers exercised. It was in no uncritical
spirit that Mr. Morley wrote: "The existence, character, and
career of this extraordinary person constituted in themselves a new
and prodigious era. The peculiarities of his individual genius
changed the mind and spiritual conformation of France, and in a less
degree of the whole of the West, with as far-spreading and invincible
an effect as if the work had been wholly done, as it was actually aided,
by the sweep of deep-lying collective forces. A new type of belief,
and of its shadow, disbelief, was stamped by the impression of his
character and work into the intelligence and feeling of his own and
modern times." Nor will Villemain be accused of rapt enthusiasm
when he writes, "C'est le plus puissant renovateur des esprits depuis
Luther, et l'homme qui a mis le plus en commun les id&eacute;es de l'Europe
par sa gloire, sa longue vie, son merveilleux esprit et son universelle
clart&eacute;." The strangest fact to contemplate with regard to this unrivaled
popularity, this astonishing range of influence, is that it truly
constitutes an apotheosis of superficiality. And this in no disparaging
spirit of Carlylese disdain for clear ideas around which hang no
mists of oracular obscurity, but rather by way of tribute to a heart that
beat responsively to human suffering, to a mind keenly sensible of
human wrongs. Voltaire rejected the subtleties of metaphysical
thought, was indeed incapable of attaining to the heights of speculative
contemplation; he was only preternaturally sensitive to the moral
defects of this imperfect world, and determined to bend all his efforts
to the alleviation of injustice and of crime. As a further concession
to his superficiality as a thinker we may frankly admit his incapacity
to originate new ideas. His mind indeed was extraordinarily receptive,
his intellectual curiosity unlimited, and hostile critics have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
availed themselves of this very receptivity as a medium of attack upon
his originality. They are free to pursue him on that score, but it does
not appreciably detract from his greatness in the eyes of posterity to
recognize that Bayle before him had preached the doctrine of toleration;
that Montesquieu had advocated the abolition of torture and of
slavery, and the sanctity of social institutions, or that Boileau forsooth
had upheld the dignity of classical formulas in matters literary.
It is rather in the mobility of his mind and in the impressionability of
his temperament that we should seek for an explanation of a philosophical
disturbance in his ideas. It is not an actual mental confusion
that I refer to, for his diction is never more limpid than in
the expression of his easy personal beliefs; but a certain intellectual
inconsistency in his habits of thought makes it impossible for us to
hold him down to any definite set of opinions which we can regard as
a genuine confession of faith. And this is a vital characteristic of
skeptical minds of his stamp, swiftly receptive, and as open as the
day to each new intellectual impulse as it arises. Thus we must
attribute to his capacity for mental development, as well as to the narrowness
of his philosophical range, the many contradictions which
his writings exhibit in such matters of intellectual belief as are wont
to give a permanent bias of thought to minds less volatile and alert.
Are we to regard him as an optimist or a pessimist? a believer in
immortality or devotee of annihilation? a fatalist or spiritualist in
history? an advocate of free will or determinism? We can not say,
and M. Faguet has amused himself with supporting each of these
opinions in turn upon its appropriate text, whose clearness is beyond
dispute.</p>

<p>If there was one set of opinions to which Voltaire may be said to
have somewhat consistently adhered I may instance his vague and
insipid deism, which relegated to God the r&ocirc;le of an absentee landlord
in this poor world which he created and governs by absolute
law, but in whose affairs he only intervenes when the death rent
is to be collected. He infers a creative God from the argument of
the clockmaker and the clock, but takes extreme pleasure in showing
how sadly the poor machine is out of order. His idea of the
social utility of an avenging and rewarding God must of course be regarded
as a freak of intellectual caprice, and yet his timid political
instincts made him regard the terrorizing influence of the doctrine
of hell with some complacency as a restraining force upon the unthinking
masses. The story is well known of the atheistic conversation
between D'Alembert and Condorcet at Voltaire's table, who
summarily dismissed the servants from the room with the remark:
"Maintenant, messieurs, vous pouvez continuer. Je craignais seulement
d'&ecirc;tre &eacute;gorg&eacute; cette nuit." The <i>Dictionnaire philosophique</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
confirms the flippant utilitarian point of view, which we must beware
of regarding as a personal conviction. "I insist particularly on the
immortality of the soul, because there is nothing to which I hold more
than the idea of hell. We have to do with a host of rogues who have
never thought; a crowd of petty people, brutes and drunkards and
thieves. Preach to them if you will that there is no hell and that the
soul is mortal. As for me I will cry in their ears that they are
damned if they rob me." It is needless to add that convictions of
this eminently practical nature did not seriously hamper Voltaire in
his anti-religious crusade.</p>

<p>To every branch of letters Voltaire brought the same splendid
qualities of mind, and need I add the same defective qualities of conscience
and carelessness of the truth when his personal glory or his
material advancement were concerned? The sordid pages of his life
would weary us in the turning, yet his native generosity and sympathy
incline us to charity; and it is wonderful how his never-failing wit
can temper his vindictiveness for us, now that the sting has lost its
living poison.</p>

<p>I have referred to Professor Dowden's unsatisfactory treatment
of the international reactions which characterize the literary history
of the eighteenth century. There is another omission which I have
remarked in the book on a reperusal of the pages devoted to Rousseau
and the encyclopedists. It might have been easily within the scope
of a literary story of even moderate dimensions to have more explicitly
accounted for the crumbling of the old classical ideal, to have
shown that the once impregnable citadel of classical art was rotten at
the base, and that those who still defended the imaginary stronghold
were themselves the unconscious agents of its destruction. With
reference to the irreligious influences of Cartesianism and the philosophical
system of Bayle I shall say no more, save that the evident
loss in prestige of the traditional religious faith, combined as it was
with the rapid decentralization of the sovereign power in the state,
must perforce make impossible the survival of literature on the old
national basis. Again, in point of pure art a decline was inevitable
in connection with the revival of Cartesianism among writers of the
stamp of Fontenelle; for their prestige was synchronous with the triumph
of the modern party in the famous quarrel; and no student of
the <i>Art Po&eacute;tique</i> will fail to appreciate the &aelig;sthetical significance of
an abandonment of classical standards of taste as an unimpeachable
canon of art. Defending as Boileau did the supreme value of reason
and good sense, what justification could he have found for poetry
unless he had proved to the satisfaction of his generation that poetry
better than any other mode of expression could render permanent
the promptings of the diviner reason, as witness the eternal monuments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
of ancient art in the domain of poetry? The triumph of the
moderns then turned men's faces in other directions, and whether
literary art should henceforward advance or decline, it must at least
strike root in a newer soil.</p>

<p>The inroads of sensibility into French literature, as exemplified
in Marivaux and Pr&eacute;vost in the thirties, followed swiftly by the
rank and file, also wrought havoc in the old classical method, though
this fact may not without further reflection be conceded. But in
the broad realm of psychological observation, where classic art had
reigned supreme, the influx of a certain morbid sensibility strangely
warped the mental vision of the observer. Diderot, a veritable sinner
himself in this respect, admits as much in an unguarded moment:
"L'homme sensible est trop abandonn&eacute; &agrave; la merci de son diaphragme ... pour
&ecirc;tre un profond observateur et cons&eacute;quemment un sublime
imitateur de la nature." Every one knows Voltaire's na&iuml;ve statement
which bears condemnatory evidence to the bluntness of his psychology.
"La nature est partout la m&ecirc;me." And is it not, we ask, this
enigmatical typical man, out of space and out of time, for whom the
chimerical theories of universal perfectibility were soon to be woven?</p>

<p>It is incontestably true, then, that the character of human observation
undergoes a sensible alteration in the course of the century,
and that whereas the individual man had been heretofore studied
inasmuch as he was in himself of typical value, henceforward not
man the individual will be the object of study, but the observation
of human relations will usurp the field, and psychological analysis
will yield to social investigation.</p>

<p>I would add a word or two by way of conclusion to illustrate how
the encyclopedists in their propaganda, aided in part by the coincident
influence of Rousseau, established ideals of thought and conduct
which were in the most violent contrast to the ideals cherished in the
preceding century. Of course, we readily understand that the
encyclopedists threw to the four corners of heaven the outworn
respect of religious and political tradition. Furthermore, we may
ask ourselves what it is which in a sense makes Moli&egrave;re and La Fontaine
isolated in their century; and the answer will not be far to
seek when we realize that these two alone of all their fellows urged
the suspected authority of instinct as a sufficient guide for conduct.
Yet how far were not even these bolder spirits from the natural man
of Rousseau or of Diderot?</p>

<p>The views of the two centuries concerning the authority of reason
seem at first sight to coincide, yet, while bearing Boileau in mind, we
can confidently assert that the doctrine of the sovereignty of reason
was not established as a principle of thought until the culminating
years of the eighteenth century. Pascal's "taisez-vous raison imb&eacute;cile"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
indicates how attempered and attenuated by spiritual faith
were the dictates of pure reason in his day, and the reason of Boileau,
as I have already observed, was strongly tinged with &aelig;stheticism. I
need not, with reference to eighteenth-century reason worship, go
further than to refer the curious of enlightenment on the subject to
the masterly works of Morley on the period in question, in which it is
precisely this unflinching devotion to reason or unreason (if the sage
of Chelsea will have it thus) which stimulates his calm and logical
temperament to positive enthusiasm.</p>

<p>A last element of contrast between the centuries is of interest in
connection with the habitual mode of thought which Godwin and his
political disciple Shelley borrowed from eighteenth-century French
sources with reference to the true relations subsisting between laws
and morals. The seventeenth-century mind held tenaciously enough
to the theory that it is the <i>moeurs</i> of a nation that inspire the laws,
but the encyclopedists were inspired in their undying hope of
amelioration and human progress to perfectibility by the contrary
theory that men, after all, are only bad because the laws have made
them so.</p>

<p>It may be conceded, then, that these broad relations of literary
movements one with the other, the conflict of converging tendencies,
and the more evident causes of the growth and decay of powerful
manifestations of a nation's thought, are of quite sufficient moment
to have merited fuller treatment at the hands of the eminent critic
who has in all other respects fulfilled his task so admirably, that having
regard to the necessary conditions of the subject, it would be above
criticism if anything could be.</p>

<h2>THE BOTANY OF SHAKESPEARE.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By THOMAS H. MACBRIDE.</span></p>


<p>The universality of Shakespeare is the common remark of critics.
Other great men have been versatile; Shakespeare alone is universal.
He alone of all great men seems to have been able to follow
his own advice, "to hold as it were the mirror up to Nature." On
the clear surface of his thought, as on a deep Alpine lake, the whole
shore lies reflected&mdash;not alone the clouds, the sky, the woods, the
castles, the rocks, the mountain path by which the shepherd strolls;
not alone the broad highway by which may march the king in
splendor the peasant with his wain; but even the humbler objects by
the still water's edge, the trodden grass, the fluttering sedge, the
broken reed, the tiniest flower, all things, all Nature in action or
repose finds counterpart within the glassy depths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence it is that no man, at least no English-speaking man, reads
Shakespeare wrong. Everybody understands him. Here is a sort
of Anglo-Saxon Bible in which, so far as the world goes, every soul
finds himself, with all his hopes, his doubts, his whims, depicted. We
are therefore not surprised that everybody claims a share in Shakespeare;
rather claims the poet as his own. The Protestant is sure that
Shakespeare despised the hierarchy; the Romanist is quite as certain
that he loved the Church. There exists an essay to prove him a
Presbyterian; another to show that the great dramatist was a Universalist.
A volume has been written to prove the man a soldier;
another that he was a lawyer, a printer, a fisherman, a freemason;
and here are five or six articles to show that Shakespeare was a
gardener.<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a></p>

<p>All this simply means that the poet had a marvelous faculty for
close observing; that his vision was accurate, his instinct wonderfully
true. It may be therefore worth our while to study for a little this
remarkable man from the standpoint of a naturalist, to see how he
who so vividly paints a passion can paint a flower; how the man who
limns a character, till beyond the photograph it starts to actuality,
will catch the essential feature of some natural truth.</p>

<p>We shall nowhere lack for material. The plays are full of references
to plants and flowers of every sort. England in Shakespeare's
day, as now, was a land of bloom, and the poet but reflects the loveliness
of beauty and color spread about him. But he does something
more. He is not content with flashes of color and breathings of odor,
he goes into detail and gives us the individual plant unmistakably.
In his description he shows an exactitude, a discriminating perception
that, had it been turned to Nature's problems seriously at all,
must at once have transformed the science of his age. But Shakespeare
was not a man of science; he was a poet. In his views of Nature
he resembles the great poets of the world, notably Goethe; and,
like Goethe, he not infrequently outruns the science of his time, uses
his imagination, divining things invisible. Moreover, Shakespeare's
plants are living things; they form a garden, not a herbarium. They
stand before us in multitudes, so that it is difficult for the present purpose
to know what to select. We must be content with a few specimen
forms brought out in quotations no more extensive than seems
necessary to the argument. Of course, there are many plants to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
discussed of which Shakespeare never heard. He does not speak
of many sorts of fungi, of slime molds, microbes; he knew nothing
about these. The microscope had hardly been invented, and the
unseen world was as yet largely personified. And yet Shakespeare
has not failed to note the visible signs of some of our microscopic
forms. Critics have wasted their time and the patience of mankind
in an effort to identify Hebona, the "leperous distilment" poured
into the porches of the royal ear. Almost profitless are such discussions.
Yet we may note that we have here to do with an effect;
the means of producing it need not be too closely questioned. Before
the rush of action, the weird setting, the voice of an apparition, the
excited audience cares not what the mysterious vial may contain&mdash;ebony,
henbane, yew, or whether it were entirely empty. What is
called for is a speedy and mysterious taking off. Had the scene
been laid in Italy, the effect had been reached by the fateful prick
of a jeweled pin, some ring upon a Borgian finger whose pressure
was the paralysis of death. But the king died of no such curari.
Note the symptoms (Hamlet, i, 5, 64-73):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The leperous distilment; whose effect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holds such an enmity with blood of man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That swift as quicksilver it courses through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The natural gates and alleys of the body,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a sudden vigour it doth posset<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And curd, like eager droppings into milk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thin and wholesome blood; so did it mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a most instant tetter barked about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All my smooth body."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These are the symptoms of blood-poisoning, vividly portrayed; of
some contagion, communicable by infection. In foul old London
Shakespeare had doubtless seen endemic, zymotic diseases of every
description, and drew his picture from the life. Royal blood is notoriously
unsound, royal habit leaves the porches of royal ears especially
exposed. On our supposition the vial need not have contained
very much, not even ebony. The dramatist had plenty of
mystery ready to his hand, and the Hebona is perhaps intentionally
ambiguous. Bacterial diseases were of old called plagues; they fell
from heaven. Listen to King Lear:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hang fated o'er men's faults, light on my daughters!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Or Caliban:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All the infections that the sun sucks up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By inch-meal a disease!"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Or they were attributed, as already intimated, to unseen personal
agencies:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins at curfew, and walks
till the first cock; he gives the web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes
the hare-lip; mildews the white wheat, and hurts the poor creature of earth."</p></blockquote>

<p>I quote this latter rather also to show the accuracy and compass
of Shakespeare's vision. How many people, not farmers, have seen
wheat whitened by the blight! And that is exactly the description,
white not "to the harvest," but whiter still to sterility and death.</p>

<p>But leaving aside all microscopic forms which may or may not
be incidentally touched upon everywhere, we may turn our attention
next to cryptogamic plants which are positively defined. The
sudden springing of mushrooms, for instance, especially at night,
so unreal and yet realities withal, made their creation a suitable
trick for Prospero:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"You demi-puppets that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear the solemn curfew."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The "green sour ringlets on the fields whereof the ewe not bites"
are "fairy rings." The same thing appears in the speech of Dame
Quickly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The expressure that it bears, green let it be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More fertile-fresh than all the field to see."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Fungi, toadstools, mushrooms, and so forth, are fructifications
only; the vegetative part of the plants permeates the soil, feeds on
its organic matter, and spreads almost equally, we may assume, in
all directions from the point of starting. When now this vegetative
growth has accumulated energy to form fruit, the sporocarps or
mushrooms rise all around at the limits of activity; hence, in a circle.</p>

<p>The fungi cut a small figure in Shakespeare&mdash;i. e., considering
their numbers and almost omnipresence. But we must remember
that they were at that time studied by few, their significance and interest
little suspected. They formed part of the realm of the world
unseen; they came and went at the instance of powers unknown,
mostly personified, imaginary, a misty population, the thought of
which kept for long ages the childhood of our race in terror. Shakespeare
saw the forms of unstudied plants, everything visible to the
naked eye, and really omitted very little. He speaks of mosses&mdash;the
lichens were included with them&mdash;chiefly as indicative of age
in the object in which they rest:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Under an oak, whose boughs were mossed with age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And high top bald with dry antiquity."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then again he simply touches them, but in such a way as to reveal
his full appreciation of their beauty, as in Cymbeline, iv, 2.
For the decoration of Imogen's grave the ruddock would bring
flowers&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"... bring thee all this;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To winter-ground thy corse."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The "furred moss" to "winter-ground thy corse" is exquisite.</p>

<p>Ferns, though so much larger, so handsome, and in our day so
all-attractive, failed generally to impress our fathers.</p>

<p>Butler, writing in 1670, has this to say:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"They spring like fern, that infant weed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Equivocally without a seed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have no possible foundation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But merely in th' imagination."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now, as far as Shakespeare was concerned, ferns answered his purpose
without seed just as well as with such visible means of perpetuity.
His only reference is I Henry, iv, where Gadshill says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We have the receipt of fern-seed, we walk invisible";<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and Chamberlain replies:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nay, by my faith, I think you are more belonging to the<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In this connection Ellacombe suggests the doctrine of signatures.
The God of Nature had written for us his human children prescriptions
all over the leafy world. The remedy indicated by its form its
own application. Thus a heart-shaped leaf was good medicine for
cardiac troubles, a lung-like leaf was good for consumption, a lungwort
in fact, and so a liverwort, a spleenwort, and the like. Gerarde,
and, in fact, all the old medical writers throughout the centuries, are
full of this. Now, what more natural than that a plant which could
thus perpetuate itself age after age by means invisible should be able
to confer the much-sought gift of invisibility, the power to disappear
and reappear at pleasure? Many people so believed. Shakespeare
appears to have been skeptical.</p>

<p>Turn we now to the flowering plants: the amount of material at
our disposal, as already indicated, is immense. Shakespeare was evidently
a great lover of flowers simply as such. His pages from first
to last are ornate with color, almost redolent of roses, lilies, eglantine,
with every conceivable metaphor and trope&mdash;"the bud of love," the
"nettle of danger," the "flower of safety." Their lovely shapes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
ever before him; he is spellbound with their beauty. "England itself
is a sea-walled garden." Grammatical forms may vanish, if only
the flower may live. Compare Cymbeline, ii, 3:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Ph&oelig;bus 'gins arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His steeds to water at those springs<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On chaliced flowers that <i>lies</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The image of the morning flowers, the fiery steeds that drink them
dry, shall fascinate us so that we forget the grammar. It will not
do to say lie; the word must rhyme with "arise," and further on
with "eyes":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And winking Mary-buds begin<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To ope their golden eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With everything that pretty is,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My lady sweet arise."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For the Queen of the Fairies he spreads this sort of a couch:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight," etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such cases reveal the impress, the healthy, happy impress which Nature
could exercise on this the foremost man of all the world, the
harmony between Nature and Nature's child. All the plants in the
last quotation are wild flowers, except the musk-roses, and these are
so common in England as to be almost wild. The eglantine was the
sweetbrier, said to be wild in all the southern part of the island and
popular in the literature of all recorded centuries. Gerarde describes
as follows: "The leaves are glittering, of beautiful green color, of
smell most pleasant.... The fruit when it is ripe maketh most
pleasant meats, and banqueting dishes, as tarts and such like, the
making whereof I commit to the cunning cook, and teeth to eat
them in the rich man's mouth."</p>

<p>The sweetness of the leaf of the eglantine is referred to by Shakespeare
in another passage which I venture to quote now for another
purpose, to show the accuracy of his description as applied to simple
flowers. The lines are from the scene quoted before. Arviragus
and Guiderius would bury the swooning Imogen. They think her
dead (Cymbeline, iv, 2):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose; nor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The azured harebell, like thy veins; no, nor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out-sweetened not thy breath."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Primroses when pale are the palest of all withering plants. The
flowers change color with maturity, especially after fertilization.
The paleness of the primrose is the pallor of decay. But the azure
harebell&mdash;behold it waving on its slender stipe beneath the shade of
some great rock&mdash;who can look into its delicate cerulean cup again
and not bethink him of the blue-veined eyelid sleep that falls upon
our human flowers!</p>

<p>The same accuracy of detail is evinced in many other places.
Take, for instance, Shakespeare's description of the violet all the
way through. It moves him chiefly by its odor (King John, iv, 2):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To throw a perfume on the violet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To smooth the ice, to add another hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is wasteful and ridiculous excess."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nevertheless, we have violets dim, and violets blue, and purple
violets, and more particularly "blue-veined" violets, as if the poet
looked with a lens into the very throat of the flower which Frenchmen
call a thought. "And there is pansies&mdash;that's for thoughts."
His description of the elm is equally exact (Midsummer-Night's
Dream, iv, 1, 47-49):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gently entwist; the female ivy so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enrings the barky fingers of the elm."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is nothing better than that, as you may prove by examining
the twigs of even some of our American species; the cork elm, for
instance. The hawthorn, the cedar, and the pine and the oak especially,
are most naturally treated. These are Shakespeare's familiar
trees. The cedar of Shakespeare is the cedar of Lebanon, commonly
planted throughout Europe since the time of the Crusades.
Shakespeare had probably seen specimens in England. He uses it
as the type of all that is great and fine. One author thinks he
copies Ezekiel, chapter xxxi. The pine was beside him all the
while. He knew the secret of the pine knot, and well describes it
(Troilus and Cressida, i, 3):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"... checks and disasters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grow in the veins of actions highest reared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deflect the sound pine and divert his grain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tortive and errant from his course of growth."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Any one who has ever examined the case, or even one who has
handled knotty lumber, has seen the wood fiber run around the persistent
base of some dead limb, and can appreciate these lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>All these quotations show that Shakespeare used his own eyes
and used them well. He saw the real distinctions of things, the
hoariness on the willow leaf. He found character in the oak as
in the king, and beauty in both. In many of his notices of natural
objects, however, the poet is not the original observer. He often
uses current opinions, fancies, dreams, for these also were the realities
in his day, quite as much sometimes as oaks and forests. There
is concerning plants a sort of orthodox mythology, and thousands of
years have sometimes contributed to the reputation born by a single
species. A curious illustration is found in what Shakespeare has
to say about the mandrake (Antony and Cleopatra, i, 5):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Give me to drink mandragora.<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Why, madam?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I might sleep out this great gap of time."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Othello, iii, 3:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Not poppy, nor mandragora,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which thou owedst yesterday."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Juliet, reflecting on her proposed entombment in the dark grave of
the Capulets, exclaims (Romeo and Juliet, iv, 3):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Alack, alack! is it not like that I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So early waking, what with loathsome smells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shrieks like mandrake's torn out of the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Environ&egrave;d with all these hideous fears?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The mandrake <i>Atropa officinalis</i> belongs to the <i>Solanace&aelig;</i>, and,
like others of the family, has narcotic properties. This was doubtless
known to Shakespeare, as in the passage cited he compares the
mandrake with the poppy. The groaning and shrieking are, of
course, the purest superstition. The root of the mandrake was supposed
to resemble the human form. The favorite habitat assigned
to the plant was the foot of the gallows, and men believed that in
some way the bodies of criminals were reproduced in the growing
plant; their very pains and cries renewed, especially for him who
profanely dared to pull the mandrake from the earth. The curious
may consult Gerarde.</p>

<p>These ideas, it is needless to say, are very old; Pliny refers to
them, and, if I recollect well, Vergil has his hero pull up some
plant amid the strangest of sights and sounds. With these old
myths are tied up, perchance, the mandrakes of King James's version.
Nay, the superstition still survives; look at the woodcut in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Webster's Unabridged, and you will discover that the artist who
set out to illustrate the word mandrake for that somewhat venerable
authority was by no means able to free himself from the ancient
spell. Credulity is evermore a factor in the compound called human
nature. Men love to be fooled, or to find some support for belief
in manifest absurdity. There is nothing so silly but has its advocates
among men who ought to know better.</p>

<p>A year or two since, a man brought from Ohio to the University
of Iowa an innocent five-parted, digitate, black fungus. It was
treasured in alcohol. Why? Because of its origin. An honest
mechanic meeting with accident lost his fingers under the surgeon's
knife. The amputated members were neglected, but presently discovered
and duly buried in the garden. The following spring from
the "identical spot" uprose a swarthy hand, black without, white
within. The hand was a perfect <i>main-de-gloire</i> for that sensation-loving
community. The matter was discussed in newspapers. A
long and careful account of the wonder was prepared, put in print
and circulated among the friends of the deceased&mdash;fingers! "What
fools we mortals be!" For sheer superstition and crass stupidity
who may say that the nineteenth century may not yet discount the
days of the virgin Queen?</p>

<p>But I said at the outset that Shakespeare had in some instances
anticipated modern scientific teaching. To illustrate this in its most
striking instance, I am compelled to offer a somewhat long quotation
(Winter's Tale, iv, 4, 76-106):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"<span class="smcap">Polixenes.</span><span style="margin-left: 8em;">Shepherdess,</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fair one are you, well you fit our ages<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Here we have brought out very distinctly the effect of cross-fertilization
in flowers, the result of grafting and the development
of varieties. Better than that, we have here the recognition of that
tendency in organisms to vary that lies at the very root of the development
of species. Natural selection, survival of the fittest, were
impossible were it not true that "Nature is made better by no mean
but Nature makes that mean"; or, as it is more broadly stated a
few lines further on, "This is an art which does mend Nature, change
it rather, but the art itself is Nature." I consider these very remarkable
statements when we reflect on the time in which they were
written. Darwin, in 1860, does but unfold the thought. The selection
which Shakespeare notes as practiced by gardeners, and a similar
selection seen in the world of domestic animals, gave Darwin his cue
of natural selection. The beauty of Darwin's thesis lies in the fact
that the process is natural, and such is Shakespeare's dictum. Later
on, lines 112-128, Perdita brings out another remarkable observation
that has only lately been confirmed by the conclusions of science:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"... Now my fairest friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Become your time of day; and yours; and yours;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wear upon your virgin branches yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Dis's wagon! daffodils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That come before the swallow dares, and take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That die unmarried, ere they can behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright Ph&oelig;bus in his strength&mdash;a malady<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flower-de-luce being one!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Primroses are dimorphic&mdash;i. e., on the same species we find flowers
of different sorts. These are complete, but in any particular flower
the essential organs fail of adaptation to each other&mdash;the style in one
too long, in another too short, to receive pollen from the stamens
of its own flower. For fertilization such flowers are absolutely dependent
upon the assistance brought by insect visitors. Perdita's
primrose is <i>Primula veris</i>, the early primrose, "that takes the winds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
of March with beauty," and dies ere it beholds "bright Ph&oelig;bus in
his strength," and it is precisely this species that forms the basis of
one of Darwin's earliest and most fruitful studies in the cross-fertilization
of flowers. The styles in one form of the early primrose
are three times as long as in the other, the stigmas differ, and the
coadaptation of the parts of the different flowers extends even to
the grains of pollen. Such flowers in the absence of insects are entirely
unproductive. Insects are rare so early in the year, and accordingly
many of the primroses die, as Perdita says, "unmarried."</p>

<p>Of course, it is not pretended that Shakespeare knew anything
of this; but that he should have discovered the fact that the early
primrose bears little or no seed, and that he should have been impressed
by the truth that this is due to lack of fertilization, is wonderful.
This circumstance might well lead to the suspicion that the
poet was a gardener.</p>

<p>We must not forget to notice, too, in this connection, that carnations&mdash;i. e.,
pinks&mdash;are remarkable for the great number of their
varieties. We have, if I may so say, pinks of every color, from
crimson to white, even brown it is said. This was true in Shakespeare's
time, if one may trust Gerarde again; he says, "A great and
large volume would not suffice to write of every one at large considering
how infinite they are, and how every year the climate and country
bringeth forth new sorts and such as have not heretofore been
written of."</p>

<p>Another passage in which the poet has instinctively hit upon a
scientific truth is found in Sonnet IV, the last ten lines. The beauty
of the passage as a whole is so remarkable that the delicate touches
in particular lines are apt to be overlooked:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For never-resting time leads summer on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hideous winter and confounds him there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauty o'ersnowed and bareness everywhere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, were not summer's distillation left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor it nor remembrance what it was:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lose but their show; their substance still lives sweet."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No botanist can read the line "A liquid prisoner pent in walls
of glass" and not recognize the exact portrayal of the living vegetable
cell. The living protoplasm is a liquid prisoner sure enough,
hemmed in by walls transparent. There could be no more striking
image. And when in herb and tree, in every living plant, the summer's
work is ended and hideous winter falls, the new cells, summer's
distillation left, do in all perennials actually survive, lest of the effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
of beauty, beauty be bereft. There is no more marvelous picture in
all the vegetal world than that of a great tree with all its myriad
cells, in summer so filled with the rush of life's activity and change
that we might hear its music, in autumn sinking to quiescence, and
the winter's silent chill where liquid prisoners sleep 'neath walls of
glass. The poet did not understand it; he simply prophesied better
than he knew. He makes us think of Goethe, of Lucretius. These
men made happy guesses. Lucretius especially surprises us by his
views of the constitution of matter&mdash;unverified, so far as we can
know. Goethe lived in the age of science and went on laboriously to
verify his surmises. The only natural science which Shakespeare
knew was gardening&mdash;if that may be called a science. His Sonnets
are supposed to have been written about 1590, and the first scientific
glimpse of the "prisoner pent in walls of glass" came about
1670, through the lenses of Nehemiah Grew, a Puritan physicist
and botanist.</p>

<p>I am aware that it is said by some that in a critique like this
we are apt to read much into the writings of our author. The quotations
I have submitted show, it seems to me, that this is unnecessary
in the present case at least. The words are generally unequivocal.
Of course, the language is poetical, metaphoric, but
the metaphor has reference to something else; the description is not
the metaphor. But, in fact, ought we to expect in Shakespeare very
exact or complete description? His whole art lies in the power of
suggestion. The deep impressions a man of genius makes upon our
minds lie often, if not always, in what he does not say. A word
or two and the vision rises, whether in Nature or in life, a passion
or a landscape. Take the broken phrases of Ophelia depicting her
broken heart, her "no more but so"; or the picture of the winter
woods in Sonnet LXXIII:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That time of year thou mayst in me behold<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When yellow leaves or none or few do hang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Does any one pretend that we are reading into the lines when we
appreciate the marvelous sorrow of the one picture or the exquisite
truthfulness and splendor of the other?</p>

<p>Shakespeare's natural eye was clear indeed, but none the less
he seems to have seen everything with the eye of his mind. Faraday
so saw the world of force, Newton of mathematical law, and
Tyndall's scientific use of the imagination lies in the same direction.</p>

<p>And so the man of science and the poet have much in common.
Both use the natural world, and the imagination is for each an instrument
of effort. The poet's generalization is a splendid vision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
in a world ideal, suggested, no doubt, by what is actual and liable
here and there to coincide with truth; the generalization of the scientific
man is likewise a vision, but it rests upon the actual, upon
the ascertained fact at the greatest number of points possible, and
disappoints us only that it is not everywhere coincident. The poet
dreams of Atlantis, the lost continents, the islands of the blest, and
builds us pictures that vanish with his song; the man of science
too beholds the continents rise; scene after scene he likewise makes
to pass across our startled vision; but his are history, his tapestries are
wrought in the loom of time.</p>

<p>The poet writes the book of Genesis, with the herbs bringing forth
fruit after their kind; the man of science figures fossil leaves and
cones and fruit. Only at the last do poetry and science possibly
again agree:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The solemn temples, the great globe itself&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, all which it inherit shall dissolve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like this insubstantial pageant faded, leave not a rack behind!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And when the man of science gathers all his data, and collates
fact with fact, and builds the superstructure of his vision, with him,
too, all things fade and vanish in the infinity of the future.</p>

<h2>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL EXPOSITIONS&mdash;THEIR PURPOSES AND BENEFITS.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By MARCUS BENJAMIN, Ph. D.</span></p>


<p>Industrial expositions are a natural development of the fairs
of the middle ages. The latter are believed to have originated in
the religious gatherings which afforded an opportunity for the sale
of wares to large numbers of people. Such fairs still persist in
northern Europe, and the best known of them is probably that held
three times a year in Leipsic, to which, it is said, "some twenty-five
or thirty thousand foreign merchants" are still attracted each year.</p>

<p>In course of time international exhibitions at which specimens
of the arts and industries of the great nations of the world were contrasted
came into vogue. These began with the International Exhibition
held in London in 1851, and of them three have been held
in the United States, as follows: The first in New York, in 1853; the
second in Philadelphia, in 1876; and the third in Chicago, in 1893.
The great magnitude of such expositions has led in recent years to their
specialization or subdivision into expositions at which only a specialty
was presented. Notable among such have been the following, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
were for the most part international: Of articles connected with the
leather industry, held in Berlin, in 1877; of all kinds of paper and
pasteboard, held in Berlin, in 1878; of fisheries, held in Berlin, in
1880; of electricity, held in Paris, in 1881; of geography, held in
Venice, in 1881; of cotton, held in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1881; of
early data in American history, held in Madrid, in 1881; of fisheries,
held in London, in 1883; of historical matters pertaining to Columbus
and the discovery of America, held in Madrid, in 1892; and of
hygiene, including chemical, pharmaceutical, and sanitary objects,
held in Naples, in 1894.</p>

<p>Similarly there has been a development in the United States from
local fairs, such as those of the various mechanics' institutes, typical
of which is the one held annually since 1828 in New York city under
the auspices of the American Institute, into interstate expositions.
Of these, since 1880, the following have been held: Cincinnati Industrial
Exposition, Cincinnati, Ohio, September 30 to October 4,
1883; Southern Exposition, Louisville, Kentucky, August 16 to
October 25, 1883; World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition,
New Orleans, Louisiana, December 16, 1883, to June 30,
1884; Central Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Central States, Cincinnati,
Ohio, July 4 to October 7, 1888; California Midwinter
Fair, San Francisco, California, January 1 to July 4, 1894; Cotton
States and Industrial Exposition, Atlanta, Georgia, September 18
to December 31, 1895; Tennessee Centennial Exposition, Nashville,
Tennessee, May 1 to October 31, 1897; and Trans-Mississippi International
Exposition, Omaha, Nebraska, June 1 to November 1, 1898.</p>

<p>Of the foregoing, the more important were those held in New
Orleans, in 1884; in San Francisco, in 1894; in Atlanta, in 1895; in
Nashville, in 1897, and in Omaha, in 1898; especially so from the
fact that all of these received recognition by the Government; and,
with the exception of that held in San Francisco, liberal appropriations
were made for their support by Congress. Moreover, at each
of them, excepting again that held in San Francisco, a special Government
building was erected in which the national Government made
exhibits of the workings of the several executive departments, together
with the Smithsonian Institution and its dependencies and
the Fish Commission.</p>

<p>The first named, that of New Orleans, was held as a celebration
of the centenary of the cotton industry in the United States. The
first record of cotton as a factor in the foreign trade of this country
appeared in the shipment in 1784 of six bags, amounting to about
one bale, from Charleston, South Carolina. Audubon Park was the
site on which the buildings were erected.</p>

<p>The exposition held in San Francisco, in 1894, had for its purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
the affording of an opportunity to foreign exhibitors at the World's
Fair to further display their goods in the United States, and in consequence
a great number of exhibits were shipped direct from Chicago
to the Pacific coast. The exposition was located in Golden Gate
Park.</p>

<p>The Atlanta Exposition had its inception in a belief that the agricultural,
mineral, and manufacturing resources of the South were
not adequately represented in Chicago in 1893. It was believed that
a better exhibit of the products of the Southland would tend to foster
greater trade relations between that section of our country and other
parts of the United States, as well as with foreign countries, especially
those to the south, such as Mexico. The Cotton States Exposition
was held in Piedmont Park.</p>

<p>The exposition in Nashville was designed primarily to celebrate
the one hundredth anniversary of the admission of Tennessee into
the Federal Union. Recognizing the commercial and educational
advantages to be derived from such a demonstration, it was deemed
wise to characterize the celebration as an exhibit of "the matchless
resources of Tennessee, and at the same time to lead to their greater
development." The old West Side Park was chosen as the site of the
"Centennial City."</p>

<p>The exposition held last year in Omaha had for its purposes to do
for the Trans-Mississippi States what the more local exhibitions had
done for Atlanta and Nashville. It was claimed that it would for the
"first time fully illustrate the wealth-producing power and the extent
of productive industries of the Greater West," and it did. The
exposition grounds were included within what was called the Kountze
tract and the old fair grounds.</p>

<p>Each of these expositions has been projected for distinct commercial
reasons. They have had for their immediate purposes the presentation
of the products of the region in which they were located to
their neighbors, to the nation, and to the world. In this sense they
have been simply the offspring of the fairs of the middle ages, differing
from them only in that the feature of sale has been largely
eliminated. That they have been successful in accomplishing the
results desired is beyond doubt; indeed, the expositions in Nashville
and Omaha were even financial successes. But they have done more
than this; they have accomplished a world of good in the way of
education.</p>

<p>Let us consider some of these benefits. Beginning with the
grounds, these have been given over to the charge of some competent
landscape architect under whose skillful supervision the desert has
been made to blossom like a rose. The sand hills of San Francisco
became the beautiful "Palm City," which since the close of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
exposition has become one of the most attractive spots in the Golden
Gate Park. At Nashville the landscape effects were claimed by many
to excel in beauty those of the World's Fair in Chicago. "Evergreens,
vines, and shrubs are everywhere, and three lakes break this
vista of green," was the opinion of one visitor. Besides the general
architectural effect of the buildings, which can not but impress those
who are so fortunate as to visit these expositions, there is a special
value in the reproductions of historical buildings. At Atlanta the
Massachusetts Building was a representation of the Craigie House,
the headquarters of Washington when in Cambridge at the beginning
of the Revolution, and later the home of the poet Longfellow. It
was a fortunate inspiration of the late Dr. G. Brown Goode that led
to its presentation by the State of Massachusetts to the local Society
of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The architectural
feature of the Nashville Exposition was the replica of the Athenian
Parthenon in all its artistic beauty. Every detail was true to the
original in design and coloring. It was the chief glory of the centennial,
and as it was a permanent structure it will long remain to the
"Athens of the South" a memorial of its exposition. Of less conspicuous
interest were the reproductions of the Rialto of Venice and
the Alamo of San Antonio.</p>

<p>The only architectural feature of historic character announced for
Omaha was that "the Arkansas Building will be a reproduction of the
mansion of General Albert Pike in 1843." The long oval waterway
around which the buildings were grouped afforded, however, excellent
opportunity for studying the architecture of the buildings,
which, it was claimed with much justice, approached those of the
never-to-be-forgotten "White City" in their beauty of design.</p>

<p>From the exterior to the interior is a natural method of progression.
Let us therefore pass to a brief consideration of the educational
features that are to be derived from an examination, no matter
how cursory, of the displays that are to be seen within the buildings.
First of all, and indeed frequently the most important, is the exhibit
made by the national Government. In the special building
devoted to that purpose are shown the exhibits of the several executive
departments, including also that of the Smithsonian Institution
and its dependencies, and the Fish Commission. As a result of the
years of accumulated experience there has been in each of the expositions
previously mentioned, except that in San Francisco, a distinct
improvement in the installation of the exhibits in the Government
Building, until it was recognized in Atlanta that the display was
superior to that in Chicago, and in Nashville "the best exhibit ever
made" was the verdict of those who had seen the successive expositions
previous to that in Omaha. Therefore the telling of a story by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
means of objects in the best manner possible is the result sought for
and attained most perfectly by those who installed the Government
exhibits.</p>

<p>It is, of course, understood that the purpose of the Government
exhibit is to familiarize the public with the methods of carrying on
the functions of the different departments. Thus, in the post-office
exhibit there is shown the entire sequence of postage stamps, both of
the United States and foreign countries, the various kinds of mail
bags, figures of the mail carriers in their different uniforms, and
finally models or pictures of the methods of transportation. The
Treasury Department shows the working of the mint by the striking
of commemorative medals, while a full series of the existing medals
and coins of the country are displayed in cases on the wall. The
functions of the Department of the Interior are shown by exhibits
of a series of models of some important invention, as, for instance, a
sequence showing the development of the sewing machine. In this
way&mdash;for of course the blanks and other documents are shown&mdash;the
working of the Patent Office is demonstrated; while the Geological
Survey, also of the Department of the Interior, presents a series of
minerals, showing the economical wealth of the country, together
with its maps and reports, results of work accomplished. Everything
can not be shown, but a most excellent idea of what each department
does can be had from a study of the exhibits of the Government.</p>

<p>Next in importance to the Government Building is the one devoted
to commerce, and here are usually to be found the weak points
of our American expositions. In lieu of a series of exhibits showing
the progress in a given industry or trade, we find too frequently a
collection of nondescript articles without much if any relationship to
each other. This is due primarily to a lack of proper organization in
soliciting exhibits, and also because the awards or medals of the jurors
are so often of no relative value. The second condition is an outcome
of the first. To be more specific, in Nashville there were no exhibits
from any one of the larger and well-known silver firms, and yet
American silverware has a recognized status as one of the most successful
of our American art industries. Cut glassware is another
branch in which our artisans or art workmen have achieved splendid
results, and still there were no exhibits from art glassmakers in Nashville.
Certain varieties of art pottery and art glassware, such as the
Rookwood pottery and the Tiffany glass, are seldom seen at these
smaller expositions. In consequence the juror makes an award to
the best article of its kind on exhibition, which may be but a third-rate
article compared with others; still it is the best shown in the exposition,
and therefore worthy of recognition. Another unfortunate
feature must be mentioned at this point. It is the decorative feature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
At the last World's Fair held in Paris there was a colossal
figure of George Washington in chocolate exhibited by an American
manufacturer of that article. While it might be considered
as a laudable attempt to make known to the French nation the
features of the "Father of his Country," and from that point of view
worthy of recognition, still it was no evidence of the superiority of
the chocolate, and therefore could not be considered in connection
with the giving of an award. This condition of affairs prevails at
every exposition, and too frequently an exhibit of a meritorious article
is made in such a modest manner that its claims are overshadowed by
the pretentious display of something quite inferior.</p>

<p>Two conditions thus present themselves&mdash;namely, the lack of
proper exhibits and the improper presentation of certain exhibits.
The first condition may be overcome by a more perfect canvass of the
industries of the country. In nearly every one of these there is a
national organization, and it should be the duty of that body to consider
the matter. By the appointment of committees and working
among the representatives of the industry, either a good exhibit from
the leading firms could be secured, or else a collective exhibit of the
best from many firms could be obtained. Typical of the last named
was the exhibit made by the potters of the country at the World's Fair
in Chicago. By the adoption of such a method of displaying the
products of manufacturers the possibility of the second condition
would be entirely eliminated.</p>

<p>After all, the value of these expositions is chiefly educational, and
surely no more perfect way of educating the visitor or sightseer could
be found than by placing before him a historical series of products,
beginning with the one made first in point of time, continuing with
better specimens, showing the improvements that have resulted from
increased experience and knowledge, and culminating with the finest
product now made. The contrast between the first and the last
would be indeed most striking.</p>

<p>It must not be thought from the foregoing remarks that these
interstate expositions have been lacking in the presentation of the
products of their own home industries. Far from it. In San Francisco,
in Atlanta, in Nashville, and in Omaha the local manufacturers
did themselves great credit by the admirable way in which their
goods were shown, but it was just in this particular feature that the
weak point indicated previously made itself most conspicuous. A
local silversmith could hardly be expected to compete with the more
famous manufacturers in the same line in larger cities, and yet in
the absence of an exhibit by the better known firm an award would
naturally be given to the smaller manufacturer, thus creating a
false impression to the world at large.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>It must not be assumed that the educational value of the exhibits
in the Commerce Building is without commendation. Next to making
a thing, the seeing of it is most important, and surely no one
can pass along the aisles of any exposition without noticing much that
is new or unusual, no matter what his previous experience may have
been. It is in this connection that the foreign section is frequently
most instructive. Warm furs from Russia and the north, rich fabrics
and strange metal ware from the Orient, rare porcelains from Copenhagen,
and brilliant glassware from Bohemia and Hungary, tell the
story with striking vividness of the special products of the Old-World
nations.</p>

<p>As has been shown, the finished products of manufacturers are
those that are housed in the building devoted to commerce and
manufacturing, but the raw materials require a building or two for
themselves. That in which the products of the earth are exhibited
is usually designated the "Minerals and Forestry Building." This
requires but brief mention, and has its chief interest for the expert.
Geological specimens, including paleontological and lithological exhibits,
show the age and character of the soil, while the rocks further
indicate the possibilities of the territory, for they show the geological
horizon. In natural order are shown the minerals of the country.
At Atlanta and Nashville the richness of the mineral wealth of the
Southern States was fully demonstrated. Not only ores such as
those of iron and manganese, but the combustible minerals, as coal,
lignite, and petroleum, were exhibited. More striking, perhaps, are
the great numbers of economic minerals that these expositions show.
The materials&mdash;phosphate rock, sulphur, and nitrates&mdash;used in making
artificial fertilizers; the marbles; the pigment-yielding minerals,
including ochres, umber, and barite; the clays, with their products
of earthenware and pottery, bricks, and tiles; and even mineral waters
are among the different minerals to be seen. It is from such exhibits
that something of an idea is obtained of the enormous wealth that is
contained in the earth, waiting only to be excavated and fashioned into
articles of beauty and utility. While such exhibits are frequently
to be seen in museums, still the average mind is more impressed by
the casual examination of these things in expositions, and one's pride
of home increased by the rich stores of mineral wealth attractively
installed. It is customary also to show models of the machinery
used in mining, and even books, maps, and drawings are not uncommonly
seen.</p>

<p>A similar arrangement is followed in regard to the forest products.
Logs and sections of trees, as well as samples of wood and timber
of all kinds, are shown. Then come the finished products&mdash;boards,
shingle, and moldings&mdash;and finally the manufactured articles, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
as pails, tubs, and then furniture. Barks, as for tanning or dyeing,
seeds and gums, and the wood pulp for paper are on exhibition.
Among the miscellaneous products deserving mention are fibers, as
used in basket-making or cane work.</p>

<p>Forestry as a science is made the basis of a series of exhibits. These
include timber culture, tools used, and methods employed in planting
and caring for trees. And finally lumbering as a science finds a place
in the scheme followed in this department. This includes the tools
used in lumbering and the methods employed, as well as exhibits illustrating
the tan-bark industry, the turpentine industry, and the charcoal
industry. So it happens that there is much that can be learned
by the student who will devote a little time to the analysis of the
exhibits in the building devoted to the products of the mines and the
forest.</p>

<p>A visit to the Agricultural Building reveals to the interested observer
those products of the soil that are for the most part the result
of cultivation, and so we find exhibits of cereals&mdash;wheat, oats, barley,
and the like&mdash;and then their immediate products: bread, pastes such
as macaroni, and starches. The sugar-yielding plants, together with
honey and the manufactured product, as candy and other confections,
come next in order. The root crops, such as potatoes or beets, and the
vegetables, are of much importance. Preserved meats and food
preparations, dairy products, spices, tea, and tobacco are among the
articles on exhibition. Then come the plants yielding fibers, as cotton
and the like; but we hasten on to make mention of the exhibits
of implements used in agriculture and its special subdivisions, such as
horticulture, viticulture, floriculture, and arboriculture. Who will
gainsay the fact that the farmer can not do otherwise than learn much
from a visit to the home of the products of the soil? It it also customary
to include a live-stock exhibition during some period of the exposition.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of the building devoted to the finished
products of manufactures and of the buildings in which the crude
materials are displayed. Besides these there are usually several
buildings devoted to the exhibition of the means by which the original
substances, whether from the mine, forest, or farm, are made up into
the commercial product for the merchant. One of these is called the
"Transportation Building," and in it we find the various means by
which the raw materials are conveyed to the factory. From the
lower forms of transportation of which man is the motive power, such
as the wheelbarrow, upward through the various forms of vehicles of
which the power comes from horses and other animals, until as the
topmost member of the series is shown the magnificently equipped
train of railway cars, provided with all the conveniences that modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
luxury can devise. If the visitor is not content with land locomotion,
more than likely he can find an exhibit in which transportation on
water is possible, as by means of a naphtha or steam launch.</p>

<p>Machinery is the active means by which the immediate transposition
of the crude material into the finished article is accomplished.
And in a building where the ceaseless belt moves with the rapidly revolving
pulley may be seen the many forms of machinery which the
active brain of the ingenious mechanic has devised to cheapen labor
and increase production. The change of the cotton fiber into cloth,
or the passage of the silken thread into the finished handkerchief;
the revolving cylinder on which the virgin sheet of white paper becomes
the printed purveyor of news; or the many and varied appliances
by which the piece of leather is fashioned into a covering for
the foot; or again the means by which the strip of steel is made into
a pin or needle, are among the interesting things that may be seen in
Machinery Hall.</p>

<p>Conspicuous among the many interesting wonders of science that
were shown at the Centennial, in 1876, were the few, insignificant,
blue, flickering, and unstable lights that ushered into existence a new
era in the history of electricity. In Atlanta, in Nashville, and in
Omaha a building was necessary to hold the appliances and products
of the latest of our sciences. Telephones no longer impress us by
their newness, and the appliances of electricity to heating and lighting
are now household necessities. To those who treasured the memory
of the beauty of the lighted Court of Honor at the White City in
Chicago there was given a greater joy when the entire grounds of the
beautiful Centennial City in Nashville were illuminated with more
than seventeen thousand incandescent lamps. Daylight had faded
into darkness only to emerge into an electric day of brilliancy unsurpassed.
Thus was told the story of the progress of the science which
as a result of the studies of Franklin, Henry, Morse, and Graham Bell
may well be regarded as the American science.</p>

<p>A parting word must be given to the amusement features. How
the Streets of Cairo, now so hackneyed, linger in one's memory! The
Enchanted Swing was one of the novel features of the Midwinter
Fair in San Francisco, and of weird interest was the Night and Morning
in Nashville. The Mexican and Japanese villages were excellent
features in Atlanta, and so was the Chinese village in Nashville,
although the "Old Plantation" was more popular. Panoramas such
as that of the Battle of Gettysburg, or pyrotechnic spectacular shows
such as The Storming of Wei-Hai-Wei, are of value. The musical
features must not be forgotten, even if popular fancy leans toward
Dixie, for the occasional "Gems from the Operas" help to leaven the
mass. At Nashville the military drills by the national and State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
troops were of considerable interest, and much had been hoped for in
Omaha in this respect, but the war prevented.</p>

<p>In this analysis, incomplete, it is true, of these American interstate
expositions something has been shown of their design and more
of their benefits. They have had for their purpose the exhibition of
the materials, processes, and products of manufacture, but their ultimate
benefit has been that of education. To the thoughtful an opportunity
has been afforded of following the crude material through the
processes of manufacture until the finished product has been exhibited.
The variety of crude materials was shown him, the different processes
were contrasted, and finally the completed article was exhibited which
possessed this merit or that advantage according to the process followed.
For the mere pleasure-seeker there were the delights of
attractive surroundings, the beauty of the exhibits, and the delights
of music or other entertainments. Indeed, all the influences are for
good.</p>

<p>Let it then be the effort of every one, whether official, exhibitor,
or visitor, to use his influence to improve and elevate these expositions
so that only the most desirable localities shall be chosen in
which to hold them, and let the selection of exhibits be made so as to
include the most worthy; for then, and only then, will the visitor derive
the greatest benefit.</p>

<p>And so from time to time and in various places we shall have
these interstate expositions, which will show to the world the advancement
made in the development of the resources of our great country.</p>

<h2>BOOKWORMS IN FACT AND FANCY.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By WILLARD AUSTEN.</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What is a bookworm? Tell me if you can;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I merely mean the insect, not the man&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A reptile whom a wit like Hood might dub<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A grub that grubs in Grub Street for its grub."<br /></span>
<span class="i15"><span class="smcap">Robert Rockliff.</span></span>
</div></div>


<p>So much mystery has gathered around the term bookworm, so
much imagery has been employed in depicting the appearance
and devastations of this mythical creature, that many have been prepared
to accept almost anything, no matter how fabulous, that might
be said about this unknown enemy of literature. Reaction against
these weird and fantastical accounts is indicated by the question, not
infrequently asked, "Are there such things as bookworms?" Few
are aware that in this creature we encounter another case of masquerading,
that these "destroyers of the Muses" are common enough
pests playing other r&ocirc;les than those in which they are familiarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
known. Some of them are met with daily in the house and elsewhere,
and arouse no unusual interest, while the world goes on
wondering what a bookworm is like.</p>

<p>Insects injurious to books and bindings are not a new subject.
The Greeks and Romans observed and wrote about them, but notwithstanding,
their knowledge of zo&ouml;logy, comparatively speaking,
was so meager, they do not seem to have felt any of the mystery or
wonderment about these creatures which we have felt. The terms
<i>blatta</i>, <i>tinea</i>, <i>silphe</i>, are frequently met with in the works of classical
writers, and, while we can not be sure of the particular species they
intended to allude to by these terms, we do in many instances know
from the context that the creatures known to them had like characteristics
with those known to us, and that they were given to literary
depredations as are their descendants.</p>

<p>The earliest allusion to a book-destroying worm which has come
down to us from classical lore was rescued from oblivion by the lad
Salmasius in 1606, when he discovered the manuscripts of the anthology
of Cephalas in the library of the Counts Palatine at Heidelberg.
Among the fragments in this collection is one attributed to
Evenus, the sophist-poet of Paros, who wrote about 450 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>, in which
the "foul destroyer" is thus berated:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O worst enemy of the Muses, devourer of the pages of books,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foul destroyer that lurkest in a hole, ever feeding on what thou hadst stolen from learning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me, black-colored bookworm, why dost thou lie in ambush to injure the sacred decrees while fashioning thy envious image?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Aristotle, in his History of Animals, mentioned the "little scorpionlike
creature found in books"; a characterization which obtains
to-day for the little creature which Leunis calls the "<i>B&uuml;cherscorpion</i>."
Horace addresses his finished book, to which he imputes an
unbecoming haste to be displayed on the booksellers' stalls, thus:
"When thumbed by the hands of the vulgar, you begin to grow
dirty, then you will in silence feed the groveling bookworm." Ovid,
in his exile at Tomi, likens the "external remorse of its cares" which
his heart feels to the gnawing of the <i>tinea</i>.</p>

<p>Considering the fact that Pliny is said to have comprised in his
Natural History all the knowledge of the natural sciences then known,
it is a little surprising that he had not more to say regarding book
insects. Here and there in his writings, however, he speaks of worms
in connection with books and papers in the same casual way as other
classical writers, causing you to feel that he was conversant with
their destructive tendencies. The epigrammatist Martial in the first
century, and Lucian in the second, both use the term bookworm;
Martial, in much the same way as did Horace, warning his book of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
fate awaiting it; Lucian, in his well-known dialogue, The Dream;
or, The Cock, as a symbol of the condition to which miserly man
may descend.</p>

<p>Sufficient has been said to show the attitude of the ancients toward
these little pests, that had no more regard for their precious thoughts
than for the utterances of modern "statesmen," whose speeches are
"read by title and ordered printed."</p>

<p>Crossing the cloistered period of the ages called dark, when books
were so few and so constantly used by the jolly monks that these little
creatures must have had a difficult time getting a living unobserved,
we come down to the sixteenth century, by which time books had
begun to multiply and worms to propagate. In the last quarter of
this century we find Pierre Petit, who is numbered among the celebrated
pleiade of Latin verse writers along with Rapin, Commire, and
others, addressing these "impudent creatures" in a thirty-four-line
Latin poem titled In Blattam.</p>

<p>A curious and interesting characterization of some species of book
insects has come to us in the writings of Christian Mentzel, the German
naturalist and philologist, who lived in the seventeenth century.
When one reads that he heard the bookworm crow like a cock, and
said, "I knew not whether some local fowl was clamoring or whether
there was but a beating in my ears," one can not help wondering if
there was not something defective in his ear drums; but further on he
says, "I perceived, in the paper whereon I was writing, a little insect
that ceased not to carol like very chanticleer, until taking a magnifying
glass I assiduously observed him." From this one concludes
that if the fault were not with his hearing, by which some well-known
sounds made by book insects seemed to him like the crowing of a
cock, an altogether different cock from the kind we know must have
lived in his day.</p>

<p>The earliest observations on the subject possessing any scientific
value were made by Robert Hooke in his Micrographia, published in
London in 1665. In many respects this work was a curious medley
of facts and fancy. The registers of the Royal Society, of which he
was a member, testify to the eagerness with which Hooke hurried
from one inquiry to another with "brilliant but inconclusive results."
Among the many objects which engaged his attention was
an insect which he described in a chapter entitled Of the Small Silver-colour'd
Bookworm. His description shows it to have been the "fishtail,"
by naturalists called <i>Lepisma</i>, well known as one of the pests
that not infrequently is found in the library as well as other parts of
the house.</p>

<p>Many interesting instances of the discovery of bookworms are
found in the literature on the subject, showing the keen interest felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
in the search for specimens of the "destroyer," many of them revealing
the fact that some unique and curious creature which stands alone
in its taste for literary food was sought. Mr. Blades reported in 1858
that he found specimens in some black-letter fragments at the Bodleian
Library, that were recognized by the librarian, Dr. Bandinel, who
crushed them with his thumb, saying, as he wiped his thumb nail on
his coat sleeve, "O yes, they have black heads sometimes." The
librarian of Hereford Cathedral, the Rev. F. S. Havergal, contributes
his observations, covering a period of eighteen years, during which
time he reports that he found two distinct species. From his description,
however, it appears that he failed to recognize that the two
were the larva and imago of the same species. Many cases of the finding
of bookworms reported in England and America are not accompanied
with sufficient data to determine just what they were. These
contribute to the general impression that many have sought but few
have found what were thought to be "genuine bookworms," while on
every hand are those creatures which under the right conditions become
book destroyers.</p>

<p>Research among the literature concerning library pests reveals
the fact that no less than eleven different groups have members that
are directly or indirectly accused of injuring books and bindings.
The number of species in each group ranges from one to eleven,
making a total of over thirty different species. In addition to these
there are others against which the evidence is at best only circumstantial.
It is not necessary to say that none of these bear any resemblance
in any period of their existence to worms, and that the term
bookworms is a misnomer. The word has become so firmly fixed in
literature, both in its figurative and literal sense, that its misuse will
no doubt continue.</p>

<p>The larger number of these are included in the class <i>Hexapoda</i>,
or insects. Two species belong to the class <i>Arachnida</i>, which embraces
the scorpions, spiders, mites, etc. One of these, <i>Chelifer cancroides</i>,
known as the "book scorpion," although not a true scorpion,
belongs to the order <i>Pseudoscorpiones</i>, and is probably what Aristotle
had in mind when speaking of the "little scorpionlike insects
found in books." The other species is known as <i>Cheyletus eruditus</i>,
of the order <i>Acarina</i>, or "cheese mites." These two are known to
be carnivorous in their habits, and there is some question as to whether
they haunt books for the purpose of feeding on them or on other
creatures to be found there.</p>

<p>Of those in the class <i>Hexapoda</i>, which comprises all the other
known book pests, there can be no question as regards their destructiveness.
Many are known about the house by the name of the
article they are most frequently found in, and unless driven by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
lack of those things more to their liking, they do not invade the literary
sanctum. Some are so cosmopolitan in their tastes that they
seem to take whatever is most convenient, whether it be books or
boots, pepper or poison.</p>

<p>As has been said, the earliest observation of value was made by
Hooke on <i>Lepisma</i>, commonly known as "fish moth" or "silver fish,"
from its resemblance, in shape and coating, to a fish; also as "bristle
tail," from its caudal appendages. They are found in closets, cupboards,
and clothes baskets. Opinions have differed as to its destructiveness
to books, but the weight of evidence is against the insect. It
seeks the paste and sizing used about books, and this leads it to attack
bindings and labels. There is a theory that paste made from pure
starch is not to their liking, but this is not substantiated by observation.</p>

<p>Termites or "white ants," another misnomer, since they are not
true ants, are also well-known ravagers whose deeds of destruction
assume a serious aspect, especially in the tropics. "Humboldt,"
according to Shimer, "informs us that in all equinoctial America,
where the white ants abound, it is infinitely rare to find papers or
books that go back fifty or sixty years." Their destruction to timber
has been the cause of serious accidents, at one time so weakening the
supports of a dwelling that a whole dinner party was precipitated
from the third floor to the basement. These pests belong to the order
<i>Isoptera</i>. The American species is known as <i>Termes flavipes</i>, and
several well-authenticated cases of their having done serious injury
to books and bindings in this country are recorded. As the chief
sustenance of these insects seems to be dead wood, it may be that the
increased use of wood in paper will make modern books, which bookworms
are said to scorn, more tempting than ever to them.</p>

<p>By opening quickly some old book which has lain long unused,
one may see tiny pale creatures with knowing black eyes scurrying
across the pages. These insects are known as "book lice," or by the
Germans as "<i>Staublaus</i>" (dust louse). Entomologists have given
them the high-sounding name <i>Atropos divinatoria</i>. They belong to
the family <i>Psocid&aelig;</i>, of the order <i>Corrodentia</i>. Some writers, beginning
with William Derham, in 1701, are of the opinion that this
delicate little creature makes a noise like unto that of the coleopterous
insect called "death-watch." These little fellows are said to have
stout jaws with which they do damage to books, dried plants, etc.,
"nibbling away the leaves and covers of the former."</p>

<p>Of all the insects that injure books perhaps the best known are
the cockroaches, scientifically called <i>Blattid&aelig;</i>, of which there are five
species whose bookish habits are unquestioned. Many instances of
serious damage done by them to the bindings of books are on record,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the most important, perhaps, being that of the Natural History
Museum Reports, at Albany, where Mr. J. A. Lintner found a hundred
volumes or more so badly damaged by roaches that they could
not be moved without coming to pieces. The United States Senate
Reports, bound in cloth and leather, some fresh and new, have been
badly damaged at Washington, in the efforts of these pests to get at
the paste with which the covers were fastened to the volumes. The
species known to commit these depredations are the "Croton bug"
(<i>Blatta germanica</i>), smaller than the others, but considered by some
writers as the worst pests of the family; a little larger species, called
<i>Periplaneta orientalis</i>; and a large species, known as <i>Periplaneta
americana</i>, or <i>Kakerlac</i>. Against two other species, <i>Blatta australasi&aelig;</i>
and <i>Blatta gigantea</i>, there is not so much evidence.</p>

<p>Among the moths, or millers, order <i>Lepidoptera</i>, are found several
species which injure books, the best known being the <i>Aglossa
pinguinalis</i>, commonly called "grease moth." The larva of this
species is at first a pale, flesh-colored grub, but as it matures it becomes
quite black. It injures bindings by constructing long "silken
tubes," in which it remains until full fed. Sometimes they spin a web
between the volumes, "gnawing small portions of the paper with
which to form their cocoons." This species belongs to the family
<i>Pyralidid&aelig;</i>. Of the family <i>&OElig;cophorid&aelig;</i> two species are known to
injure books: <i>Acompsia pseudospretella</i>, and an undetermined species
of <i>Depressaria</i>. Under the name <i>&OElig;cophora</i>, William Blades describes
the ravages of the former on two leaves of a "Caxton," and
accompanies his remarks with a photographic illustration of the damaged
leaves, from which it is at once seen how irregular is the gnawing
of this species. The newspaper account of the finding of bookworms
in the Lenox Library not long ago classed the larv&aelig; found
with this species.</p>

<p>The largest number of book-destroying insects are found among
the beetles, of the order <i>Coleoptera</i>. To this group belong the "book
borers." The species thus far considered have been more or less
dilettantes in literature. The beetles, however, seem possessed with a
true spirit of investigation, and when they undertake a piece of work
in a serious fashion they go to the bottom of it, sticking close to the
line laid down. This characteristic distinguishes these insects from
all others, and makes it comparatively easy to determine when they
have been at work in a worm-eaten volume. No less than sixteen
different species of this order have been either detected in this work,
or such strong circumstantial evidence has been found against them,
that there is little doubt as to their guilt. Some insects seem to destroy
books for the sheer want of something better to do; some do so
in seeking the paste and sizing used in and about the books; others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
because the leather bindings are desirable material in which to undergo
transformation; and, again, others haunt book shelves and books
in search of prey in the form of living creatures. But among the
beetles are found tiny little grubs that seem to have a genuine intent
to destroy; that set out deliberately to wreak vengeance on man's
record of his thoughts, deeds, and discoveries, and, as if knowing the
means which man uses to destroy, have sought to imitate him in the
effects produced. As a result we find books filled with small, round,
shotlike holes strongly suggesting the results which might follow
from the use of the family Bible by the restless boy as a target for his
first shotgun.</p>

<p>The book-destroying beetles are all grouped under three families:
<i>Dermestid&aelig;</i>, <i>Scolytid&aelig;</i>, and <i>Ptinid&aelig;</i>. The <i>Dermestid&aelig;</i> include the
"flower beetles" and the well-known "carpet bug." The species of
which there can be no doubt as to its disposition to pierce book bindings
is <i>Anthrenus varius</i>, which Glover says "is a very pretty insect
when examined under a magnifying glass, being beautifully marbled
or variegated with black and gray." Another member of this family,
against which there is less evidence, is <i>Dermestes chinensis</i>, so named
by Dr. L'Herminier, of Guadeloupe, who reported a loss of nearly
four hundred volumes from its ravages. Erichson believes this to
have been the well-known <i>Anobium paniceum</i>. <i>Dermestes lardarius</i>
and <i>Attagenus pellio</i> are others of this family mentioned in the same
category.</p>

<p>The family <i>Ptinid&aelig;</i> includes two groups, <i>Anobium</i> and <i>Ptinus</i>,
the first being generally known as the "death-watch," from the peculiar
sound, like the tick of a watch, which is produced by striking
against a hard substance with their tiny jaws. Superstitious persons
have long considered this noise an omen of death, hence the name.
Instead of an ill omen, this noise proves itself to be a love-call between
the sexes, and may be imitated accurately enough to elicit a response.
One of the best known of these beetles is called <i>Sitodrepa panicea</i>,
generally known in Europe as <i>Anobium paniceum</i>. It is a cosmopolitan
feeder, having a reputation in several different fields of activity,
commercial and scientific as well as literary. To druggists it is known
as "the worm," and their stock of ginger, rhubarb, Cayenne pepper,
nux vomica, and belladonna root all appear to be equally to its liking,
tin foil being no formidable barrier to its persistent search. Leather
dealers have suffered from the destruction wrought by this little fellow
to such an extent that whole cases of boots and shoes, carriage trimmings,
etc., have been ruined. To this species belongs the insect found
a few years ago at work in a volume of Dante's Divine Comedy, which
had been sent to Cornell University library from Florence. The
larv&aelig; are about three to four millimetres in length, of a dirty-white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
color, head tinged with brown, and black mouth parts, with the abdomen
strongly curved. The adult is a small, cylindrical, brown
beetle from two to three millimetres in length, with head bent down
and wing covers marked with fine punctate stri&aelig;.</p>

<p>Professor Poey made extensive observations of an insect in Cuba
which had destroyed about four thousand volumes. He called it
<i>Anobium bibliothecarum</i>, and Schwartz thinks the injury reported
by Herminier from Guadeloupe should be attributed to the same
species. <i>Anobium striatum</i> and <i>pertinax</i> have long been known to
injure books by their "gnawing and burrowing," not only in and
through the bindings, but also entirely through the volumes. <i>Nicobium
hirtum</i>, a native of southern Europe, where its larv&aelig; have been
found doing like injury, is only locally abundant, and for this reason
has never been considered a serious library pest. Schwartz says,
"In one way or another the insect has found its way to North America,
but has always been regarded as a great rarity with us."</p>

<p>The <i>Ptinus</i> group embraces <i>Ptinus fur</i>, <i>Ptinus mollis</i>, <i>Ptinus
brunneus</i>, and <i>Ptilinus pectinicornis</i>, called by Leunis "<i>B&uuml;cherbohrer</i>."
According to Butler, a peculiarity of this genius&mdash;that of
dissimilarity of shape between the sexes&mdash;is well illustrated by the <i>P.
fur</i>, the male being almost cylindrical, the female inflated or rounded
at the sides; so much variation that they might be taken for two different
insects. <i>Ptinus brunneus</i>, although similar to <i>P. fur</i>, is distinguished
from it by being wholly of a light-brown color and destitute
of whitish bands on the wing covers. Some writers speak of this
species as the "book beetle," while <i>Sitodrepa</i> is spoken of as the
"spice beetle." Dr. Henry Shimer makes the following statement
regarding their method of boring: "They usually operate in leather-bound
or half-bound volumes by boring galleries along in the leather....
They usually bore along quite under the surface of the leather,
cutting it almost through; occasionally a small round hole penetrates
through the leather to the outer surface."</p>

<p>One of the most famous cases on record of insects boring through
books is that reported by M. Peignot, in which he states that twenty-seven
folio volumes were pierced through in so straight a line that
a cord might be passed through them and all the volumes raised by
means of it. Different writers give the credit of this feat to different
members of this group, so that the most that can be said is
that it was the work of some member of the <i>Ptinid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>In the family <i>Scolytid&aelig;</i> only one species belongs to the book
ravagers. It is known as <i>Hypothemus eruditus</i>, and was described
by Westwood in 1836 as "pitchy black, the head of the same color,
entirely concealed from above by the front thorax." It is very
minute in size, being about one twentieth of an inch in length. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
far as its depredations have been observed it confines its work to
the bindings of books, making furrows in all directions much as it
does in the sap wood of dead trees. The strong resemblance of its
burrowing to the gouging done by an engraver's chisel has given to
this family the name of "engraver beetles."</p>

<p>A review of the different families of insects whose habits under
favorable conditions lead them to infest books and bindings will
show them to be more or less well defined according to their feeding
habits. The book scorpions and mite, <i>Cheyletus eruditus</i>, which, as
we have seen, do not come under the head of insects, are primarily
carnivorous, and their presence in books may be due to the fact that
they find there animal as well as vegetable food. This is certainly
true of the book scorpion, which feeds on mites, book lice, and other
small insects. The "fish moths" or "silver fish," the "book lice," and
the "cockroaches" can have no other reason for infesting books than
their liking for farinaceous substances such as are used in and about
the bindings and labels of books. For this reason the damage done
by them is largely confined to the exterior or interior of the bindings,
and only so much of the book itself is injured as comes in their way in
their search for food. The "white ants" feed principally on wood,
and in and about books there is more or less wood fiber which would
be to the liking of these voracious feeders. The moths and beetles
are the burrowers and borers. They seek retired places in which to
lay their eggs where the larv&aelig; will be surrounded with food for their
growth. The moths and some of the beetles are more given to burrowing
in the bindings, keeping close to the outer surface for the purpose,
it is thought, of making it easy for the imago to emerge after the
change is completed; while others bore straight tunnels often from

<p>A natural conclusion for one who has gone over the literature of
book-injuring pests to reach is that the many persons that have been
industriously looking for the bookworm, as well as those that have reported
the finding of isolated specimens, some dead, some alive, have
had in mind the one creature which bored holes in books. The frequent
use of the terms "genuine bookworm," "the real bookworm,"
etc., reveals the fact that the users of these phrases approached the
subject with a preconceived idea of the kind of creature they should
find to account for the ravages only too apparent on scores of volumes
which pass through the hands of booksellers and book keepers. To
many the boring beetles are the only creatures which are rightfully
called bookworms, and in their search other book pests have not been
taken into account.</p>

<h2>HYDROPHOBIA IN BAJA CALIFORNIA.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By DANE COOLIDGE.</span></p>


<p>When, in 1884, Pasteur discovered the true nature and cure
of hydrophobia, he dispelled the accumulated superstition of
centuries regarding this mysterious and dreaded disease. But in
some countries where hydrophobia exists his cure is not yet known,
and the old superstitions remain. While collecting mammals near
San Jos&eacute; del Cabo, in the cape region of Lower California, two
summers ago, I found the country people very fearful of wild animals,
especially of skunks and coyotes. My Mexican boy, whom I
had sent on an errand, remained perched half the afternoon in a
thorny mesquite tree because he had seen a coyote and was afraid it
was <i>rabioso</i>. But they fear the skunks most of all because of their
habit of approaching men in the night while they sleep, and biting
them on the toe or ear, or any exposed part. In defense, unusual
precautions are taken to exclude them. The windows of the houses
are barred with iron, and the doors are made in halves, horizontally,
so that the lower part may be closed to keep out animals and snakes
without interfering with free ventilation. The common people, who
live in brush houses, blockade their doorways at night, and rely on
their cur dogs to attack any animal which may come near.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this evidence, and innumerable ghastly
stories, I remained a month in the country, at the rancho of Francis
Pazik, a very intelligent and well-educated Bohemian, without
seeing any rabid animals. Then, one evening just at sundown, a
crowd of men came up the path, leading one of Pazik's mules and
dragging the carcass of a skunk. They said that it had come out into
the open field where the mule was picketed and bitten it on the
hind foot. All of them insisted that it was rabid, and cited its extreme
emaciation as a proof. The young man who dragged it showed
me his great toe, half burned off with blue vitriol, and told me that a
skunk had bitten him there two months before, and the doctors had
burned it. These native "doctors" are uneducated men who live
on the superstition of the people. In the case of hydrophobia their
methods are characteristic. There are in the cane fields little insect-eating
animals called shrews which, in that country, give off a scent
so like that of a skunk that Pazik has hunted them out with his dogs
in the night by mistake. The "doctors" pay as much as two dollars
apiece for shrews on urgent occasions, and, mixing their bodies with
herbs and roots, form a concoction which they claim will ward off
hydrophobia. Besides this, they also bleed the patient and cauterize
the wound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>According to the Mexicans, there are two kinds of rabies: that
affecting the head and that affecting the stomach. When animals
have <i>rabia</i> in the head they become stupid and move about slowly,
biting at everything they see or touch. They are not violent, and
become very thin. But when they have rabies in the stomach it
gives them great pain, and they bark and howl and race about frantically,
chasing other animals and tearing them. Mr. Cipriano
Fisher, of Santa Catarina, told me of his experience with a coyote
which had rabies in the stomach. He was hunting deer at Cape
San Lucas, and had killed two. Carrying the smaller one and his
gun to camp, he returned unarmed, except for the knife which
every one wears in that region, to bring in the other. As he went
down a deep ca&ntilde;on he heard a coyote ahead, howling in the peculiar
way which he knew to be characteristic of the <i>rabioso</i>. All the
hunters claim they can recognize the howling of a rabid coyote, and
they say that no other animal will answer it or go near it. The howling
approached rapidly. Knowing that he could not escape by running
back uphill, nor kill it with his knife without being bitten, he
stepped quickly into the brush and cut a long green club. As he
turned back into the open place he saw the coyote down the ca&ntilde;on,
leaping up and snapping at the air. When the coyote saw him it
broke into a furious run up the trail, and when, as he says, about
thirty feet away, made a flying leap at his face. He jumped to one
side, struck the rabid animal in the back of the head as it passed, and
killed it with the one blow.</p>

<p>Skunks are particularly dangerous to persons who sleep out at
night. J. Ellis McLellan, a field collector of the United States Department
of Agriculture, whom I met at San Jos&eacute; del Cabo, told me
of an unpleasant experience he had with a skunk while coming down
from La Paz. On account of the heat he had ridden in the night as
far as Agua Caliente, where he stopped near a ranch house to sleep
till morning. Although the night was warm, he covered his head
with a <i>serape</i> for protection from insects and wandering animals.
Early in the morning he was awakened by a twitching at his blanket
and, raising the <i>serape</i>, saw a skunk biting and jerking at it. Realizing
the gravity of the situation, he reached for his heavy knife, and
then, suddenly throwing aside the <i>serape</i>, he leaned forward and put
his whole force into one blow. As he ducked under the blanket
again, for protection, the dogs from the house rushed out in a body
and pounced upon the dying skunk, which they worried on top of
McLellan until the ranch people beat them off. When skunks bite
at men's toes and ears, or at blankets in this way, it is taken as an
indication that they are rabid.</p>

<p>Shortly after this I saw a young man at Miraflores who had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
been seized with hydrophobia. Two months before he had been
bitten on the great toe by a skunk as he lay asleep in his house at
Agua Caliente, but had shown no symptoms of the disease until that
day, when he suddenly began to bite at the door jamb in the store
at Miraflores. They put him into the brick jail, where he soon became
very violent. When I went down to the jail the next morning
I found a group of Mexicans about the huge wooden door, which was
chained fast and tied with <i>riatas</i> in addition. From the inside there
came a succession of thumps and blood-curdling groans and strangles.
I peered in through the barred window, and saw the unfortunate man
lying on his back in a corner, spasmodically kicking out his legs from
his chest and rolling his dilated eyes. Suddenly he leaped to his feet
and, grasping the iron bars, shook the great door violently, chained
and tied as it was. Then he seemed to leap against the walls, and at
last fell down, groaning. He soon became rational again, and began
to talk through a crack in the door to an old man whom I took to be
his father. He asked for water, but they would not give him any, and
while he was pleading for a knife or pistol another spasm seized him.</p>

<p>Presently the judge came over with two policemen. They said
they were going to take the <i>rabioso</i> out and tie him to a tree, because
he was getting the jail too dirty, and might not die for a week. As
soon as the spasm passed, and the man lay weak and moaning, the
burly policemen loosed the <i>riatas</i>, and, stepping in quickly, seized
him from behind. He protested pathetically against going into the
hot sunshine, but they pushed him out and started toward the corral
to tie him up. But when the fierce sun struck him he was racked by
horrible convulsions. He kicked and struggled, bit at his shoulders,
and blew spittle into the air when he threw his head back. The
policemen breathed hard, and the old man, his father, hugged himself
in agony as he walked behind. There was a desperate struggle, then,
with a final paroxysm, the <i>rabioso</i> suddenly collapsed and hung limp
in their arms. At first they thought that he was dead, but when he
showed signs of life they carried him to the corral and tied him to a
tree before he became conscious. Two days later he died.</p>

<p>Pasteur himself does not undertake to cure patients who have been
seized with spasms; but the judge told me that, fifteen years before,
an Italian doctor had come through their country making marvelous
cures. When he arrived at Miraflores there was a <i>rabioso</i> in the
jail who was so badly afflicted and so long-lived that the judge had
ordered him to be shot. When the Italian doctor heard this, however,
he asked permission to try an experiment on the man. This
being granted, he had the patient lassoed, dragged to the river, and
held under water until he was apparently drowned. After the
<i>rabioso</i> was full of water, the doctor rolled him on a barrel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
resuscitated him; then he gave him some medicine which cured him.
Cipriano Fisher told me that he had cured a valuable bulldog of
rabies by this same method, using the bitter juice of the <i>pitahaya</i>, a
species of cactus, for medicine. This crude means of alleged cure is
unique, and seems based on the theory that the antipathy of rabid
animals to water, implied in the name hydrophobia, is the cause of
their death, and partial drowning, therefore, a cure.</p>

<p>Rabies is extremely prevalent at times in certain districts of the
Cape region. McLellan says it does not occur north of the tropic of
Cancer&mdash;that is, of La Paz and Todos Santos&mdash;and it is hardly known
in the thickly populated district about San Jos&eacute; del Cabo, but at
Cape San Lucas, and especially also along the base of the mountains
near Miraflores and Agua Caliente, where it is very hot and dry,
rabid animals are greatly to be feared. While collecting in these
mountains I passed several good ranches which had been deserted
because, as my guide said, stock could not be raised there successfully
on account of the <i>rabia</i>.</p>

<p>This man had worked as a <i>ranchero</i> or stock herder for two years
on one of these ranches, and had been obliged at one time to kill
eleven cattle and seven sheep and goats in two weeks on account of
their having rabies. It was part of his duty to follow up rabid
coyotes, foxes, skunks, and wild cats when he saw them or heard
their peculiar cry, and shoot them before they bit the stock. But he
assured me very gravely that he preferred to work in the valley for
less wages rather than have charge of Chollalito rancho; and when
we camped there for a night he slept on top of the pack boxes, with
his bare feet wrapped in blankets and a <i>serape</i> over his head, and
reverently pulled out the blessed rag he wore around his neck, in
order to more surely protect himself against the rabid skunks and
coyotes. There is, however, very little danger in traveling through
this interesting country. Cases of hydrophobia are comparatively
rare, and some scientists who have collected in Baja California have
even denied its existence there. But with the traveler, as with the
native, there remains the vague, constant, but unrealized expectation
of seeing some raging coyote come tearing through the cactus, or of
having his toe bitten in the middle of the night as he sprawls in the
heat and darkness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor Welldon</span>, in the British Association, expressed his sense of
the intellectual insolence of those who presume to say, notwithstanding our
ignorance of animal characters, that because a characteristic seems to us
minute and without importance, it is therefore without importance to the
animal. Until we know the function of the animal throughout, and can
picture its physiological processes thoroughly, we have no right to say,
<i>a priori</i>, that this or that feature is of no use.</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE SENSE OF COLOR.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By M. ANDR&Eacute; BRACCHI.</span></p>


<p>When the different rays of the solar spectrum strike the eye
separately they each produce a particular characteristic and
subjective impression, which is called color. Ingenious theories have
been set forth by physiologists, like Young, Helmholtz, Hering, and
others, to explain the perception of colors by our eye, but the problem
still awaits solution, and is not likely to be explained from that
side, because it is rather psychical. The laws regulating the perception
of colors are not physiological; we perceive only relations. We
know that the sense of color may be modified independently of that
of light and of space. Two phases may be distinguished in its evolution.
Every light, whether chromatic or not, produces a simple
luminous impression on the retina&mdash;a simple excitation of the optic
nerve, without being analyzed by it. In the second phase the
brain, the psychic center of color, intervenes. There may obviously
be considerable differences between persons in the interpretation
of what we call colors, and we may judge that there is an
education of this psychical center, and that it is an important
matter.</p>

<p>Different as the ways of interpreting a sensation of color may be,
there are still some fundamental ideas in the matter which painters,
for example, do not all observe. Some, like the impressionists,
exaggerate them, and others neglect them. Which of these are
wrong? and which right? are questions we are not concerned with,
our purpose being to show that many of the phenomena of color,
shade, sources of light, etc., escape a large proportion of persons
unless they are attentive observers. If we visit the exhibitions of
the impressionists we shall be entertained at the criticisms we hear
over the canvases of such painters as Renoir and Monet; youths
who have just come out of the drawing school declaring that their
master never taught them to put blue on a face, and that in Nature
all shadows are gray or black, and none red or violet; and we should
astonish a great many people if we should say that a white robe
should never be painted in a portrait picture with white lead alone.
"All skies are blue, all trees are green, all pantaloons are red," said
a celebrated painter who was trying to show how the habit of seeing
a colored object in a certain way prevented one from perceiving the
different colors that might be applied to it. We recollect the trouble
of a brave youth who, having sat for his portrait to a celebrated
painter, was distracted at perceiving green in the reflections of the
hair of his likeness. Yet there are in Nature shadows that are blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
and reflections that are green, and if we do not see them habitually
it is because we do not give sufficient attention to them.</p>

<p>A common division of the spectrum is into warm and cold colors.
The warm colors are red, yellow, orange, and yellow-green; the
cold colors are violet, blue, green, and blue-green. This is not an
arbitrary division, but answers to a fact of experience which passes
from our physical to our moral impressions, and may cause in us
feelings of comfort or uneasiness, joy, sadness, or moral depression.
Some persons are influenced by the gray-colored sky, others are gay
when the day is bright. It is a current expression that the color of
the southern landscape is warm. Goethe said that blue caused him
to feel cold.</p>

<p>The terms warm and cold are technical expressions in the arts.
A color tone is cooled by putting blue in it, and warmed by adding
red or yellow. "This practice is not arbitrary," says M. F. Bracquemond
in his book on Design and Color; "it copies the colored aspects
which natural light imposes on all imitation that seeks to realize the
colored and factitious light of painting. To reach this, art observes
the order according to which the natural lights distribute their various
colored elements, and classes luminous aspects&mdash;a process which
it has always observed&mdash;into the two categories of warm and cold.
Hence, so far as examples come to us, this contrast is easy to verify;
at the Louvre, for example, in works from Pompeii, and in those of
all the masters." Preyer relies upon this division of colors into
warm and cold for a comparison of chromatic sensations with thermic,
and for supposing that the color sense is developed from the sense
of temperature. Chromatic sensitiveness to this author is only a
special case of thermic sensitiveness limited to the retina. Darwin's
ideas were evidently the same; the whole human body was a sort
of retina capable of improvement; we may, it is true, suppose with
Lord Kelvin that "there is absolute continuity between the perception
of heat by the retina of the eye and its perception by means
of the tissues and nerves."</p>

<p>A very elementary experiment will easily enable us to recognize
these different qualities of colors. Set a lighted candle on a table
near a window; there are then two sources of light&mdash;the daylight,
blue and cold, and the light of the candle, orange-red and warm.
Cast a shadow on the white paper by holding a pencil straight up.
The shadows cast by the candle will be blue to a degree that no one
can mistake it, a greenish blue. Placing the pencil between the
window and the candle and looking at the shadows, we have, first,
the blue shadow of the candle, and then the shadow projected by
the cold daylight. The color of the last, though perhaps less evident
than the other, is an orange-yellow, of rich, warm tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>From this little experiment we may conclude that a warm light
provokes a cold shadow, a cold light a warm shadow, and that the
color of the shadow is complementary to that of the light. In the
experiment, daylight was the source of the cold light. Let us now
take a third source of light, warmer than that of the candle, the
flame produced by burning alcohol and salt&mdash;a very warm, deep
orange light, which makes the light of the candle seem cold and its
blue shadows appear yellow, while its own shadows are blue.</p>

<p>We recently observed a very striking example of these warm and
cold appearances of light; it was at the theater: a beam of red light
shone brightly upon an actor, whose shadow was absolutely green.
Some of the people around us were astonished at the phenomenon,
which they could perceive very plainly. Phenomena of this kind
are produced every instant in a nature illuminated by the sun;
nearly all the shadows are colored in hues which we can distinguish
with a little attention where the unpracticed eye sees nothing
but gray. Thus in a mountainous country, exposed to the warm light
of the sun, the mountains in the horizon appear blue through the
haze; then, as evening draws on, the sun appears a deeper orange,
more reddish, while the sky seems green by contrast, and the red
rays of the sun falling on the mountains turn them violet, in those
beautiful tints which give so much glory to those countries of large
shadows and bright lights.</p>

<p>However intense the light of day may be, it is therefore always
colored, and gives those colored shadows which painters do not
always observe. The painter, in fact, should make an analysis of
the complex light around him, and should repeat the result in synthesis
on his canvas. Upon hardly any other condition can he
represent the transparency of the atmosphere, or the luminosity of
a subject or a landscape. These colored shadows are not, therefore,
false colors, as often seems to be believed, or optical illusions;
they are really existent, but our eyes are hardly ever practiced
enough to discern them; we are deficient in education of the color
sense. This education is not hard to attain. There are persons who
have special aptitudes and are consequently remarkable colorists,
just as some persons have an admirably organized ear for music; but,
besides these, it is possible for all persons endowed with the faculty
of observing and capable of attention to acquire with considerable
rapidity the faculty of discerning colors, where they at present
hardly see anything but confused gray masses. (The epithet gray,
we may observe, is used as applied to many things the color of which
is not susceptible of exact determination.) Such attentive observation
of colors is, however, attended with some danger to painters. Every
person prefers some one color, is influenced by a particular shade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
When we examine the works of the painters we see that there are
many differences in the way of seeing. Some see blue, red, green;
others see clear, others obscure. In the analysis of a complex color
it happens that there is sometimes an auto-suggestion. Where there
is a hardly defined violet, the painter will exaggerate it on his canvas,
and will be obliged, in order to keep up the right tone, to increase
the intensity of the colors next to it. Hence arises a common
error with painters, who start with a true principle, but are not
able to apply it properly, and give their picture a tonic violet, green,
or yellow, beyond all reason.&mdash;<i>Translated for the Popular Science
Monthly from the Revue Scientifique.</i></p>

<h2>SKETCH OF THOMAS EGLESTON.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Prof. DANIEL S. MARTIN.</span></p>


<p>As a general rule, the work of the scientist is not of a kind to
attract conspicuous notice from the public, especially in great
cities, filled and thrilled with commercial and political activity; and
so it comes to pass that men of rare attainments and untiring energy,
in the highest walks of life and thought, may spend their whole life-time
in such an environment, and be scarcely known outside of a
limited circle of kindred minds. They may confer lasting benefits
on the community, render important services to the whole country,
and be widely known and honored in other lands, and yet receive
but little general recognition in the place of their abode.</p>

<p>Such a man, in such a community, is Prof. <span class="smcap">Thomas Egleston</span>,
of the city of New York. He has been too busy and too modest to
seek prominence in the public eye, and his scientific work has been of
a kind that does not lend itself readily to popular lectures or startling
announcements; but as a mineralogist, a metallurgist, and a
mining engineer, and as the planner and founder of the great School
of Mines of Columbia University, he has made a deep and permanent
impress on the history of science in the United States.</p>

<p>Professor Egleston is of New England stock, his ancestors having
been among the first settlers of Dorchester, Massachusetts, in
1635. Thence they came by a toilsome and perilous journey to
Connecticut, and founded Windsor, which was thenceforward their
home, and whence his father came to New York. The removal to
Connecticut arose from a desire for greater freedom of life and
worship than they found in Massachusetts; and Professor Egleston
has been deeply interested in studying the little-known records of
this movement, and the influence which it exerted, as an almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
unwritten chapter in American history. He proposes to publish these
researches, together with much other material relating to our colonial
history, in which he is an enthusiastic student.</p>

<p>He was born in New York, on December 9, 1832. As a boy
he took considerable interest in certain aspects of science, and at the
age of thirteen had gathered a collection of minerals and rocks. He
attended Yale College, and in the later years of his course took
special elective work in chemistry. After graduating there in 1854,
he was for a time an assistant to Prof. Benjamin Silliman, Jr. Subsequently
he went abroad, partly for his health, and was advised to
spend some time in Paris. With no special professional purpose, but
from a general desire to improve his time, he began attending lectures
on geology and chemistry at the Jardin des Plantes, under
D'Orbigny (a brother of the eminent writer) and Hilgard, and he
worked with much energy in the laboratories of those departments
at the Jardin. He thus attracted the attention of some of the
faculty of the &Eacute;cole des Mines, who offered him larger facilities in
that institution, which he at once accepted. After much very interesting
study in the paleontological laboratory there, he decided
to go regularly through the entire course, and accomplished that
purpose with notable success and honor, graduating in 1860. He
had worked as an assistant in every laboratory of the school, and
in the summers had traveled through much of France, becoming
familiar with its geology, mineral resources, mining works and
processes, and gaining a mastery at first hand of all branches of
those subjects. Those years were to him full of interest and enjoyment;
friendships were formed that have enriched his whole life;
and in it all the man was being remarkably prepared for the work
of developing those forms of science and of industrial progress in
our own country. Professor Egleston has always retained a strong
feeling of attachment toward the &Eacute;cole des Mines, which has likewise
been warmly reciprocated. He has shown his interest by two
gifts to the institution, of five thousand dollars each.</p>

<p>Returning hither in 1861, just as the war cloud was darkening
over the land, he received almost immediately an appointment at
Washington, to take charge of the mineralogical collections and
laboratory of the Smithsonian Institution. After two years there
he conceived the purpose that determined his whole career, and has
so greatly influenced both American science and American mineral
development&mdash;that of a school of mines at New York.</p>

<p>At that time there were, indeed, in this country schools of science,
well organized and well equipped&mdash;the Sheffield School at
Yale, the Lawrence Foundation at Harvard, the Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute at Troy, and others. But their scope was rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
general in character, and there was no institution planned and
arranged with distinct reference to mining and metallurgy as its
main subjects. Mr. Egleston, as he was then known, saw and felt
this lack, and planned to supply it.</p>

<p>There is not space here to detail the circumstances under which
he was led to prepare, in 1863, the Plan for a School of Mines in
New York; but the modest little outline then drawn up and printed
has been exceedingly rich in results. It was taken up with interest
by certain leading trustees of Columbia College, as it was then called,
especially by the late George T. Strong. The president, the late
Dr. Charles King, and a majority of the board, favored the experiment,
for so it was regarded, and arrangements were finally made
to begin it in the autumn of the next year, in limited quarters in
the old college building on Forty-ninth Street, and with provision
for but a small number of students&mdash;not over twenty. Part of the
instruction was to be given by members of the existing college faculty;
and three new professors were appointed to special chairs for
the school, to be compensated wholly by fees therefrom. These were,
Professor Egleston, mineralogy and metallurgy; Prof. Francis Vinton,
mining engineering; and Dr. C. F. Chandler, chemistry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in June, 1864, President King was succeeded by the
late Dr. Barnard, whose strong interest in science made him a warm
supporter of the school. Already some prominent people were impressed
with the value of such a movement, and disposed to aid it.
A fine collection of minerals was purchased and presented by Mr.
Strong, and another was given by Mr. Gouverneur Kemble.</p>

<p>On the opening day, November 15, 1864, the number of applicants
was far beyond expectation and provision; the school was
found to respond to a need and a demand that had not been suspected;
it was a success from the first. In a year or two it had
become an institution of recognized importance; ample quarters were
provided for it in a large building, formerly a manufactory, on the
Fourth Avenue side of the college block, and important additions
were made to its corps of instructors&mdash;particularly the eminent geologist,
Dr. J. S. Newberry, of Cleveland, Ohio, whose noble geological
collection was deposited and used in the School of Mines,
and whose breadth and power and personal magnetism so profoundly
influenced scientific interest and progress in the city of New York
for more than twenty years.</p>

<p>Such was the beginning of the school; its career has been one
of unbroken growth and increasing influence. After some ten years
it was found needful to take down the plain old transformed factory
and erect a new building on its site, with larger space and improved
facilities. Fifteen years later Columbia College was removed to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
new site on the Morningside Heights, where now the School of Mines
is installed in stately fireproof structures, wherein its great accumulated
treasures of collections, apparatus, models, and varied appliances
of instruction are safely and permanently housed.</p>

<p>The influence of this school upon science in New York city has
been incalculable. Only those who have lived in touch with the
scientific life of the metropolis during the period since the close of
the civil war can appreciate the change that has taken place in public
feeling regarding science, or can recognize how largely that change
is due to the existence of such an institution, and to the presence
of such a body of strong and able professors, in constant and active
co-operation in the interest of science. The school attracted notice
from the first, abroad as well as throughout this country. In 1871,
seven years from its opening, a writer in the North American Review
characterized it as "already more scientific than Freiberg, more
practical than Paris," and emphasized its influence both upon science
and upon mining interests in the United States, pointing out that
the literature pertaining to mines and their working had been very
limited in the English language, and that the instruction in the
school had to be chiefly given by lectures; but that these courses
would gradually develop into a literature.</p>

<p>These suggestions have been fully justified by the results of the
last quarter century. The vast development of our mineral resources
has been largely under the direction of graduates of this
school. Hundreds of them are to-day in important positions of scientific
trust, not only throughout our own country but in South and
Central America, Australia, China, Japan, and even Europe itself.
The lectures of the professors, and the articles constantly published
in the School of Mines Quarterly, have indeed given us a literature
of the subject in English. The local influence in the city has been
great, upon scientific education in secondary schools, and upon general
public sentiment; while in Columbia University the experiment
has become one of its finest departments and an element of
its greatest strength. Rarely is it given to a man to see in his life-time
so great a result from the plans and the labors of his earlier
years.</p>

<p>Of the many forms of scientific activity which have engaged
Professor Egleston during his busy life, only the briefest mention
can be made. He was one of the founders of the American Institute
of Mining Engineers, was thrice its vice-president, and was chosen
president in 1886; and he has published over one hundred articles in
its Transactions. He was one of the founders of the American
Metrological Society, and of the societies of Mechanical Engineers
and of Electrical Engineers, and a member of the society of Civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
Engineers and of the Iron and Steel Institute of Great Britain. In
the New York Academy of Sciences he was active for many years,
and held the vice-presidency from 1869 to 1881. In 1866 Professor
Egleston was associated with the Agricultural and Geological Survey
of the Union Pacific Railroad; in 1868 was appointed a United
States Commissioner to examine the fortifications of the coast; and
in 1873 was one of the jurors for the International Exposition at
Vienna. From Princeton and Trinity Colleges he received, in 1874,
the degrees of Ph. D. and LL. D., respectively, and from the Government
of France the rank of a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor
in 1890, and the exceptional rank of "Officier" in 1895.</p>

<p>His papers, published either separately or in the proceedings of
the several engineering societies above mentioned, the Annals of the
New York Academy of Sciences, the School of Mines Quarterly, etc.,
cover a wide range of subjects connected with mineralogy, metallurgy,
and mining operations. In mineralogy he was especially
devoted to crystallography, and his noble private collection was
gathered and arranged with relation to that department. Besides
his strictly metallurgical articles and treatises, he has dealt with
such topics as rails, in relation to accidents; furnaces and their
construction; fire-brick and refractory substances; slags and their
utilization, etc.; the decay of building stones, in connection with
the Obelisk; technical education, manual training, and improvement
in the conditions of workingmen in mining and metallurgical
occupations.</p>

<p>His chief published works are The Metallurgy of Gold, Silver,
and Mercury in the United States, two large volumes, 1887 and 1890,
and his Lectures on Mineralogy, to which may be added his Tables
for the Determination of Minerals, Metallurgical Tables on Fuels,
Iron, and Steel, diagrams and comparisons of crystals and crystal
notation, tables of production of many of the metals, report on the
Union Pacific Railroad survey of 1868, and many others.</p>

<p>Within the past two years Professor Egleston has withdrawn from
active work in the School of Mines, and bears now the title of
Professor Emeritus; his health has been a good deal impaired, and
his work has passed largely into the charge of younger men who have
grown up under his direction as students and assistants. During
the last winter he has presented to the school his entire scientific
library and his private collection of minerals above referred to,
some six thousand specimens. These, in addition to the great
mineralogical treasures already possessed by the institution, all gathered
and arranged under his supervision, will make the School of
Mines collection certainly one of the finest in the country.</p>

<p>Although devoted to his own special branches, Professor Egleston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
had given a striking example of broad interest in other departments
of science in his labor of love in connection with the monument to
the memory of the great ornithologist Audubon. The present writer
was closely associated with him in this work, and can testify to his
energy, enthusiasm, and perseverance therein. The later years of
Audubon's life had been spent on Manhattan Island, in a modest
but beautiful suburban home on the Hudson, above Harlem, known
as Audubon Park. He died in 1851, and was buried in a family
vault in Trinity Cemetery, then far out of town, now lying between
One hundred and Fifty-third and One Hundred and Fifty-fifth
Streets, Amsterdam Avenue, and the Hudson. The spot was remote
and almost unknown, and with the death and removal of most of the
family, it had fallen into neglect. When One Hundred and Fifty-third
Street was to be opened through to the river, the vault, which
was close to the street line, was in danger of injury; and then Professor
Egleston took up the matter and proposed to the trustees
of the cemetery that if they would grant another plot in a better
location, he would endeavor to have a handsome monument erected
by national subscription. The trustees responded warmly, and Professor
Egleston undertook the work. Before going abroad in 1887
he broached the subject to the writer, and suggested that he present
it during the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science, which was to be held during that summer in New
York. The writer gladly responded to the plan, and in August of
that year laid the facts before a general meeting of the association.
Much interest was expressed, but no action was taken, as had been
hoped. At the first regular meeting of the New York Academy
of Sciences, in October, the writer again presented the subject, with
better result; and a committee was appointed by the academy, consisting
of Professor Egleston as chairman, Dr. N. L. Britton, and the
writer. On the return of the former from Europe the work was
taken up in earnest; and under the indefatigable efforts of the chairman
and of the secretary, Dr. Britton, although with many delays
and discouragements, it was carried to a triumphant success.</p>

<p>Before the end of the year (1887) the committee had held numerous
meetings, prepared and issued a circular, and engaged the
co-operation of several other organizations with the Academy of
Sciences, including the American Ornithologists' Union, the Agassiz
Association, and the Audubon Society (for the protection of our native
birds). A design was proposed by the academy's committee, and
adopted by the joint committee of the several societies; this design
originated with Professor Egleston, and was a striking combination of
the religious, scientific, and artistic elements appropriate to the purpose.
The scheme was that of a Runic cross, the only form of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Christian symbol which can properly bear ornamental devices, according
to the canons of artists and architects, and this was to be
covered with reliefs of the birds, quadrupeds, and flowers that Audubon
so loved and studied, and that have given him his fame as the
artist-naturalist of America. The general design being approved,
the selection and arrangement of the animals and birds was given
to a subcommittee of specialists, consisting of Dr. J. A. Allen, Mr.
G. B. Sennett, and Dr. N. L. Britton, whose duty was to secure
accurate representation and artistic grouping of the forms.</p>

<p>In all these combined aspects this monument is doubtless unique.
As it stands to-day over the grave of him whom it commemorates&mdash;graceful,
dignified, and altogether peculiar&mdash;it is an honor to our
city, as well as a fitting tribute to the memory of Audubon, the
Nature-lover, the artist, and the Christian believer. For this beautiful
thought, so nobly carried out, both American science and the
city of New York are indebted to Thomas Egleston.</p>

<p>The progress of the effort was slow; it was not until 1891 that sufficient
subscriptions were secured, and not until the spring of 1893
that all was ready for the formal ceremonies. During all this time
Professor Egleston and Dr. Britton were untiring in their endeavors
and unfaltering in their purpose to succeed. On April 26, 1893, the
monument was dedicated with suitable exercises, of great interest, at
Trinity Cemetery, and a memorial address upon the life and work
of Audubon was delivered by Mr. Daniel G. Elliott, F. R. S. E., of
the Ornithologists' Union, at a public meeting at the American Museum
of Natural History.</p>

<p>Professor Egleston has also laid the citizens of New York under
enduring obligation to him in another and even more important matter,
the preservation of one of the most valuable of our smaller parks
from the clutches of the speculator and spoiler. It is known to but
few of the residents of the city that a series of determined attempts
was made, some years ago, to destroy and obliterate Washington
Square, in the same way in which the St. John's Park outrage was
perpetrated ten years before. The method pursued in that case was
by interested parties buying up property around the park and
"colonizing" the houses with tenants who would either favor or
consent to the vandal obliteration of that beautiful spot of rest and
shade for the erection thereon of the Hudson River Railroad freight
depot. St. John's Park, however, was the property partly of a corporation,
partly of individuals, and the job was comparatively easy.
Washington Square belonged to the city; but the same process was
begun by a great real-estate magnate, and was going on toward a
similar result, when the death of the arch-conspirator checked the
scheme for a time. A little later, however, it was revived, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
the notorious Tweed <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, and would have succeeded but for the
keen insight and vigorous action of a few public-spirited citizens, led
by Professor Egleston. Washington Square had been dug over and
torn up, under the pretext of remodeling and "improvement," and the
unsightly mounds and piles of earth were left for many months, not
only to offend the eye, but to generate malaria. The ground had been
originally a Potter's Field, and the opening and upturning of the
soil, frequently unhealthy in its effect, was markedly so in that case.
The south side of the square had been "worked" already, in the
first attempt, and had largely lost its population of old residents;
but the north side was still occupied by a select class of old New-Yorkers.
Now, however, between the desolate aspect of the park
and the malaria that began to be felt, an exodus of the owners on the
north side was imminent. Then began to be hinted some schemes
for which all this was preparatory. A great militia armory was
to be erected on the western end, and other projects vaguely loomed
up, involving the ruin of the park as such. A bill to legalize these
schemes was quietly introduced at Albany, and had been brought
nearly to its passage, by "influences" no less potent for their careful
concealment. Professor Egleston and a few other gentlemen of the
vicinity were anxious about these rumors, but could get no information.
Inquiries from city officials were met with positive denial of
any such intentions, and it was only within a few days of the time
set for the passage of the bill that they succeeded in discovering its
real meaning.</p>

<p>At this late juncture the "Public Parks Protective Association"
was quietly and quickly organized by a small body of public-spirited
men, of whom the late John Jay was president and Professor Egleston
secretary. This association set itself to work most earnestly to reveal
the danger, to arouse public sentiment and public protest, and to make
these felt in the Capitol at Albany. Circulars and petitions were
prepared and widely disseminated, at the cost of great labor, within
the brief time left ere the bill should come up for passage. The
New York Academy of Sciences, speaking in the interest of public
health, passed strong resolutions of remonstrance; and various other
bodies took similar action, including the Academy of Medicine.</p>

<p>The result was that legislators were aroused, some to the real character
of measures that they had not fully understood, and others
to the existence of a public sentiment upon which they had not
counted, and the bill failed to pass. Nor was this all: a resolution
was adopted, prepared by the association, guaranteeing the ground
occupied by the square to be kept "forever" as a park for purposes
of public health and recreation.</p>

<p>That Washington Square remains to-day, an oasis of beauty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
the desert of brick and stone, and a breathing place in that densely
built portion of the great city, is due principally to the watchfulness
and energy of Professor Egleston. He it was who saved that park
to the people of New York, and a debt of lasting gratitude therefore
is owing him from them. This is an unwritten episode in the history
of our city, and the present writer, who knew something of the facts
at the time, is gratified to be able to put them on record now. But
let us not fail to note the lesson that they convey. "Eternal vigilance
is the price" of all that is valuable in a community like ours, where
the demands of business greed and the devices of political schemers
and "bosses" may at any time unite again, as in the past, for acts
of profitable vandalism, and dismiss as "sentimental" all considerations
of beauty, health, or historical association. The sanitary importance
of our smaller parks is now better understood; and the
city is buying property for such purposes at heavy cost, in localities
where fifty years ago parks could have been laid out at little
expense, and maintained at a vast saving of human health and life.
Such articles, also, as that of Dr. Stephen Smith, in the February
number of this monthly, are educating the intelligent community as
to the sanitary value of vegetation in cities. But nothing is safe
or sacred where the evil trinity of the boss, the speculator, and the
"soulless" corporation may combine their forces; and the call is for
ceaseless watchfulness.</p>

<p>Professor Egleston has been all his life in active association with
the religious and benevolent work of the Episcopal Church. He became
president of the Bible and Common Prayer-Book Society in
1871; was vice-president of the Protestant Episcopal City Mission
Society from 1870 to 1897; a trustee of the General Theological Seminary,
and a member of the corporation of Trinity Church from 1878.
In connection with the last-named body some of his relations have
an interest wider than his own denomination, and may fittingly be
mentioned in a sketch relating chiefly to his scientific career. Two
points may here be noted: the schools among the poorer classes
maintained by the Trinity corporation; and the unique jeweled
chalice in memory of his wife, presented by him to Trinity Church.</p>

<p>Aided and controlled more or less by Trinity corporation, though
in different parts of the city and in connection with different Episcopal
churches, are now eight schools, with about one thousand pupils.
In these are taught careful and scientific methods of training along
modern lines, of eye and hand development, hygiene, economy, and
thrift, to children and youth of the neediest classes. Already for
years much interested in these schools, Professor Egleston has, since
his withdrawal from professional activity, given much of his time
to their advancement, and has found intense gratification in observing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
the results of this training among a class of children that, from their
general environment, would grow up to be a burden or a menace
to the city. The intelligent culture of hand and eye, the mental
quickening and moral uplifting, the capacity and purpose of honorable
self-support, and the protection from moral and social perils,
that are imparted and secured through the agency of these schools,
are to him a constant source of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The jeweled chalice above referred to is of scientific interest
from the great variety and rarity of the gems with which it is set.
During years of travel to and from many parts of Europe, Professor
Egleston had remarkable opportunities, in his visits to mining regions
and his intercourse with mineralogists, to obtain fine and choice
specimens of gems; these he had mounted in elegant forms as presents
to his wife, Mrs. Augusta McVickar Egleston. Her death, in
1895, was a very great blow to her husband, as their married life
had been extremely happy; and the only satisfactory use to which
this beautiful treasure of jewelry could be put seemed to him to be
in the services of divine worship in the church. It is not possible
in brief compass, without a figure, to describe the arrangement of
these jewels on the base, stem, and cup of the golden chalice; but it
must suffice to say that there are one hundred and eighty stones set
in, with embossed work, on a cup and pedestal nine inches high and
half that width. The species and varieties number fifteen, many of
them in rare shades of color; among them are the ruby-colored Siriam
garnets, green "demantoid" garnets of the Ural ("Uralian emerald"),
Ceylonese moonstones, colored diamonds, sapphires, both yellow
and green (Oriental topaz and emerald), rubellites, red zircon,
moldavite (the rare green obsidian of Moravia), green tourmaline,
chrysoberyl, the rich purple amethysts of the Urals, etc. Considered
either mineralogically or as a work of art, this chalice is almost
unique; while the conception and designing, which are wholly of
Professor Egleston's own, reveal the same union of artistic and scientific
qualities that was shown in the Audubon monument above
mentioned, joined with a religious and a personal sentiment almost
too sacred to dwell upon in a sketch like the present.</p>

<p>In all these aspects of his life and work, as we said at the beginning,
Professor Egleston has been little known to the general public;
but among scientific and engineering circles he has been highly honored.
In these pages he may become more widely known, and the
people of the metropolis and of the country at large may learn
something of the manner of man that has lived and labored so honorably
among them, and has done so much for science and his fellow-men.</p>

<h2>Editor's Table.</h2>


<h3><i>SCIENCE AND THE IDEAL.</i></h3>

<p>We have had frequent occasion
in these columns to refer to
the tirades against science indulged
in by writers who, because they can
not quite make ends meet in their
philosophy of the universe, strangely
allow themselves to think that <i>science</i>
must be at fault. At one moment
it is M. Bruneti&egrave;re, at another
Tolstoi, at another it is a Harvard
professor or a Western school superintendent;
but no very long time
elapses before we find somebody in
very unnecessary trouble, as it seems
to us, over the shortcomings of science.
The last sufferer to whom our
attention has been drawn is Dr.
John Beattie Crozier, the author of
two able works&mdash;Civilization and
Progress, and History of Intellectual
Development&mdash;who has lately
written a history of his own intellectual
development under the title
of My Inner Life. This writer describes
the effect upon his mind of
a study of Mr. Spencer's Principles
of Psychology. "Then it was," he
says, "that the ideal within me,
struck to the heart, shriveled and
collapsed." This sad result was due
to the discovery, forced on him by
a study of the work in question, that
all our mental experiences have
equally a material basis, and that
from a material point of view or, as
we may say, seen from below, one
thought or feeling is as much justified
as any other. Previously he
had considered that "such higher
faculties as veneration, benevolence,
conscientiousness, and the like, were
quite distinct in essential nature
from low ones, like revenge, lust,
vanity, cowardice, and deceit"; but
now "all this was changed, and all
the faculties alike, the high and the
low, the noble and the base, the
heroic and the self-indulgent, lay on
a dead level of moral and spiritual
equality ... all alike being but
vibrations, vibrations, vibrations,
nothing more." Consequently, "the
dethroned Ideal fell prone and headlong
like a false and usurping spirit;
and my mind, bereaved of that
which had been its life, settled into
a deep and what, for a year or two,
threatened to be a permanent intellectual
gloom."</p>

<p>It is a great pity that at this critical
moment a very simple consideration
did not occur to this troubled
spirit. When we read the Sermon
on the Mount we read "words,
words, words"; when we read some
horrible piece of profanity or indecency
it is again "words, words,
words"; when we read the demonstration
of a proposition in Euclid
it is "words, words, words"; and,
again, when we take up Tennyson's
In Memoriam we find that its whole
tissue is "words, words, words."
But would it tend in the least to lessen
one's reverence for the Sermon
on the Mount to be reminded that it
was constructed out of the same
verbal elements as the piece of profanity?
or would it diminish our
admiration for In Memoriam to be
told that it was constructed of words
just like the dullest piece of prose?
If not, then why should one be so
terribly disconcerted and depressed
to find that all our mental life finds
its basis in vibrations? Or why
should the inference be drawn that,
because the basis is one, all that reposes
on it must also be one in character
and meaning? Is our delight
in the lily or the rose impaired by the
reflection that it springs from the
same soil that produces noisome
weeds; or do we gaze on the humming
bird with less admiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
because it flies in the same atmosphere
as the bat? Why should "vibrations"
not be the condition of existence
of one mental phenomenon as
well as of another? Surely the very
fact that Dr. Crozier classes all the
feelings he mentions as mental affections
should prepare him to believe
that they have a common basis. But
how feelings shall be classified and
ranked <i>after they have taken form</i> is
a question precisely similar to the
question how the various combinations
of words should be classified
and ranked. In the latter case
words are the basis of them all, but
we say: "This is an epic poem; this
is a moral essay; this is an immoral
novel; this is a silly joke; this is a
market report." Are these distinctions
illusory because words are the
basis and substance of all these various
forms of composition? Does
the poem lose anything of its beauty,
or the essay anything of its ethical
value, because each was not composed
of elements altogether peculiar
to itself? The solid globe itself was
once a diffused nebula, but we do
not on that account find a less varied
beauty in flower and tree, in hillside
and running brook and grandly
flowing river.</p>

<p>In his sad condition of mental
disarray our author betook himself,
he says, to the counsels of Thomas
Carlyle. That sage, when he heard
that his visitor had been reading
Spencer, made some uncomplimentary
remarks about the latter which
we hardly think the visitor was justified
in repeating. Apart from
this, Carlyle told him in effect that,
as he was in the world, he had just
to make the best of it, and that in
time he would find work that he
could do with benefit to himself and
others. Finally, our author made
what he calls a discovery and offers
as a contribution to modern philosophy&mdash;namely,
that in the mind of
man there is a "scale," according to
which thoughts and feelings are appraised.
Some are high up on the
scale and some are low down. He
found that there is that <i>in</i> the mind
which is not <i>of</i> the mind, and which
sits in judgment on all the contents
of the mind&mdash;something which
smiles on every right action and
frowns on every wrong one, and yet
which he does not care to speak of
as conscience. Here was the antidote
he required to the "pure and
undiluted materialism" which had
so paralyzed his moral being in the
Principles of Psychology; and, having
obtained it, he has been living
happily, as we gather, ever since.</p>

<p>We have tried to do justice to the
originality of Dr. Crozier's conception,
but really with indifferent success.
That there is a scale by which
we are all accustomed to measure the
varying values of our thoughts, feelings,
and actions hardly needs to be
stated; and that there is substantial
agreement between men on the same
plane of civilization as to the relative
values of different mental products
is also unquestionably true.
What our author has not shown is
how this conflicts with the strict scientific
position taken in the Principles
of Psychology. He does not
tell us that he has repudiated the
teachings of that work; indeed, he
gives us distinctly to understand
that, so far as it affirms the dependence
of thought upon physical organization,
he adheres to it still. If
so, he has only built upon it a superstructure
which it was always open
to him to build; so, why he should
find fault with the foundation it is
not easy to see. Science goes as far
as she can see her way to go in setting
forth the relations between the
mind of man and the environing
universe. It studies also the human
mind in its historical manifestations,
and tries to unfold the laws
of human conduct. It confines itself
to facts which are believed to admit
of verification and to inferences
which have been tested by experience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
This is the contribution of
Science to the theory of human life.
But because Science stops here she
does not lay any veto on thought,
desire, or hope. She lays a foundation;
it is for us to build thereon
"gold, silver, precious stones, wood,
hay, stubble," each of us according
to our own impulse and upon our
own responsibility. The fire of experience
will "try every man's work
of what sort it is." But not only
may we build, we must build; no
one can live upon another man's philosophy.
We may adopt this creed
or that, but it means nothing to us
till we have worked it over in our
own mind and made it our own&mdash;with
modifications.</p>

<p>There is nothing whatever in science
that conflicts with the ideal.
Strictly speaking, science brings us
to the threshold of the ideal, and
leaves us there. "These are the
facts of life," it says; "such has
been the course of human history.
The human race has risen from
humble origins to its present commanding
position in the world; and
to-day the standards of human conduct
and the conditions of human
happiness are very different from
what they were in the distant past.
Social ties have multiplied and
strengthened. Domestic affections
have grown in depth and tenderness,
and individual happiness is now
bound up to a very large extent in
the happiness of other individuals.
The cruel superstitions of the past
have given way in many minds to a
reverent regard for a power which is
felt to rule in the universe. Of such
a power Science can not render any
exact account; but before all the
ultimate questions of existence Science
is dumb; nor can it attempt
to reconcile the antinomies which
assert themselves in all phenomena.
It is for you, the individual, entering
upon life, to make your choice
of the course you shall hold and the
principles by which you shall be
governed. The senses are the guides
to immediate pleasure, but the experience
of the ages has settled with
considerable approach to certainty
the conditions on which enduring
happiness is to be won.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Choose well; your choice is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brief and yet endless.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To the man who insists on being
knocked down with a club before he
will yield to persuasion there is nothing
in such a mode of address that
will be convincing. This is a case
in which, as Pascal says, "there is
enough light for those who desire to
see, and enough obscurity for those
who want a pretext for not seeing....
Perfect clearness might help
the understanding, but it would injure
the will." There is, therefore,
room on the scientific foundation
for the idealism of Dr. Crozier, and
for many other forms of idealism.
It is for each one of us to construct
his own ideal, and, having constructed
it, to live by it. "If any
man's work abide he shall receive a
reward."</p>


<h3><i>RACIAL GEOGRAPHY.</i></h3>

<p>The interesting papers contributed
to this magazine by Prof. William
Z. Ripley, which, we are glad
to say, will soon be published in a
more permanent form, indicate very
clearly the remarkable progress that
has been made of late years in the
scientific study of human origins.
Formerly legend and tradition were
the only sources of light upon prehistoric
times; and the sagacious
Thucydides dismissed all speculation
respecting those ages with the
curt remark that he did not think
the people who lived then amounted
to much, any way. No doubt he was
nearer right in this opinion than
were those who peopled antiquity
with demigods and heroes; still
there was much of interest to be
gleaned respecting the prehistoric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
past if only right methods of research
had been used. This was too
much to expect in his day; and, indeed,
it is only in very recent times
that the study of human origins has
been placed upon anything like an
adequate scientific basis. A reference
to Mr. Ripley's work will show
how numerous are the lines of investigation
now pursued. Language,
which at one time was considered
an all-important test of origin,
has fallen from its high position;
and theories which, on the
strength of linguistic evidence, were
very widely entertained, have lost
their authority. Particularly has
this been the case with the so-called
"Aryan" theory. It was simple
and beautiful and interesting, but as
observations accumulated it became
more and more untenable, until
finally it had to be discarded.</p>

<p>The problems which the anthropologist
and ethnologist attack are
indeed of the highest degree of complexity.
If our predecessors went
astray therein, we ourselves are only
feeling our way very cautiously and
somewhat uncertainly. We have
not yet reached an era of victorious
generalizations. Professor Ripley
well indicates the difficulties of the
research. Things will go well for a
considerable time along certain lines
of observation until the facts come
to be gleaned in some special field,
and then the result will perhaps be
just the opposite of what theory required.
In a brachycephalic region,
for example, where craniological
and other tests call for a population
of short stature, the stature will reveal
itself as much above the average.
In a region where, looking at
race characteristics as elsewhere
established, the tendency, say, to
suicide should be particularly low, it
is found by statistics to be particularly
high. The ethnologist finds
his path strewn with endless difficulties
of this nature, and yet he is
not discouraged. The truth lies
somewhere, and he knows that a
vigorous and courageous sifting of
the facts will be sure to bring it
to light, if not to-day, to-morrow.
We gather from Professor Ripley's
pages a strong impression of the
confident patience with which the
true man of science attacks his problems;
he is sure that his <i>methods</i>
are right, and that in the end they
must triumph.</p>

<p>The interesting points of view
which the study of racial geography
presents are numberless. This is
particularly shown in Professor Ripley's
chapter on Modern Social
Problems. In this chapter the writer
acknowledges, as he does elsewhere,
that theories of race and of heredity
have sometimes been pushed too far.
He demands a due recognition of
the influence of environment, and
cites cases where environment will
explain divergences from what are
recognized as race characteristics or
tendencies. An example of this is
afforded by the case of Brittany, in
connection with separateness of
home life. The population of Brittany
belongs to a race that is particularly
prone to such separateness,
and yet in Brittany there is an unusual
intermingling of families under
one roof. We can not enter into
the explanation here, but Professor
Ripley shows how the physical geography
of the country may account
for the variation from type. In the
same chapter the writer shows very
interestingly how the Celtic parts of
France manifest almost invariably
conservative tendencies: how they
shun divorce, afford a very low rate
of suicide, and, in the matter of
crime, tend rather to deeds of violence
than to acts of dishonesty.
The general impression which the
intelligent reader will gather from
the whole work is that "racial geography"
has all the interest of a
rapidly growing science; but that,
while much has been accomplished,
much more remains to be done. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
lines of research are many, and we
may reasonably hope that before
long the combined labors of anthropologist,
ethnologist, and sociologist
will give us a coherent body of
knowledge and theory which shall
not only illuminate the past but be
of the very highest value for the
comprehension of the problems of
our own day.</p>

<h2>Scientific Literature.</h2>


<h3>SPECIAL BOOKS.</h3>

<p>In a study of what constitutes the foundations of zo&ouml;logy we know of
no one better equipped to discuss the various problems than Professor
Brooks.<a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a> As an original investigator in many groups of invertebrate zo&ouml;logy,
as a student of animal life in temperate and tropical seas, as a special
teacher of embryology and zo&ouml;logy for a quarter of a century, and, above
all, as a profound student of the philosophical literature of the subject,
his equipment is thorough and complete. A fair review of this work would
be difficult without voluminous quotations from its pages.</p>

<p>The reader will find here the soundest, healthiest acceptance of the Darwinian
theory of natural selection. He penetrates the mists and fogs of
philosophical vagaries and follows the dictum of Tyndall, who, in presenting
the essentials of a discussion, says, "Not with the vagueness belonging
to the emotions, but with the definiteness belonging to the understanding"
we are to study these matters. It is fact, fact, fact. The honest "I do
not know" inspires the reader with a confidence that obscure points are
not to be juggled with. He insists that the principles of science are physical,
that a mechanical interpretation of Nature is reasonable and just.
Referring to Huxley, he remarks that faith and hope are good things, no
doubt, and (quoting from Huxley) "expectation is permissible when belief
is not," but experience teaches that expectation or faith of a master is very
apt to become belief in the mind of the student," and (again from Huxley)
"Science warns us that the assertion which outstrips evidence is not only
a blunder but a crime."</p>

<p>In the chapter of Nature and Nurture he brings many potent facts and
arguments against the idea of the transmission of acquired traits. Without
copious extracts it is impossible to do justice to this masterly presentation
of the subject. The chapter abounds in aphorisms, as indeed do
other portions of the work; and these alone, if serially collated with their
contexts, would make a valuable little handbook for the student of biology.
His chapter on Lamarck is equally strong, and the fallacies of Lamarckianisms
have never been so clearly shown. "The contrast between what we
may call the solicitude of Nature to secure the production of new beings,
and the ruthlessness with which they are sacrificed after they have come
into existence, is a stumbling-block to the Lamarckian, and the crowning
glory of natural selection in that it solves this great enigma of Nature by
showing that it is itself an adaptation and a means to an end, for the sacrifice
of individuals is the means for perfecting the adjustments of living
things to the world around them and for thus increasing the sum of life."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
"Whole books have been written on the marvelous fitness of the structure,
the instincts, and the habits of the worker of the honeybee for its life of
active industry&mdash;a life in which the male has no share, and from which the
female is cut off by her seclusion in the depths of the hive, and by her devotion
to her own peculiar duties. While the queen and the drones are well
fitted for their own parts in the social organization of the hive, these duties
are quite simple, and very different from the duties of the workers; and
as these latter do not normally have descendants, and as they never under
any circumstances have female descendants, all the workers are the descendants
of queens and not of workers.</p>

<p>"Their wonderful and admirable fitness for their own most necessary
part in the economy of the hive must, therefore, be inherited from parents
who have never been exposed to those conditions to which the workers are
adapted; and this adaptation can not be due to the inheritance of the effect
of these conditions, nor can we believe that they are inherited from some
remote time, when the workers were perfect females or when the queens
were also workers; for the sterile workers of allied species differ among
themselves, thus proving that they have undergone modification since they
became sterile.</p>

<p>"Here we have a most complicated and perfect adjustment of marvelous
efficacy to external conditions which are of such a character as to
prove that the inheritance of the effect of these conditions has had no part
in the production of the adaptation."</p>

<p>His views of bird migration, based on the matter of ovulation and not
on food supply, are extremely interesting. He says: "As their eggs are
very large and heavy, a high birth rate is incompatible with flight, and
the preservation of each species imperatively demands that every egg shall
be cared for with increasing solicitude; for while in other animals increased
danger to eggs or young may be met and compensated by an increase
in the birth rate, the birth rate of birds can not be much increased without
a corresponding restriction of the power of flight. Every one knows
how quickly birds may be exterminated by the destruction of their eggs or
young, and the low birth rate of all birds of powerful flight is a sufficient
reason for migration, for at the same time that their fitness for flight limits
the birth rate, it permits them to seek nesting places beyond the reach of
their enemies."</p>

<p>His critical estimate of Huxley is tersely presented. He says: "His
evolution is not a system of philosophy, but part of the system of science.
It deals with history&mdash;with the phenomenal world&mdash;and not with the question
what may or may not lie behind it.</p>

<p>"The cultivation of natural science in this historical field and the discovery
that the present order of living things, including conscious, thinking,
ethical man, has followed after an older and simpler state of Nature,
is not 'philosophy' but science. It involves no more belief in the teachings
of any system of philosophy than does the knowledge that we are the
children of our parents and the parents of our children; but it is what
Huxley means by 'evolution.'"</p>

<p>Dr. Brooks credits Galton with employing simple terms to express new
and abstruse truths, and we trust those who are continually wrestling with
the dead languages to pick out new and distracting words to express their
conceptions will profit by Galton's method.</p>

<p>The lecture on Natural Selection and the antiquity of life is replete
with original and pregnant suggestions based upon the results of his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
profound investigations on pelagic life. Here again only ample quotations
from his pages would convey an adequate idea of their value and
importance. In his chapter on Louis Agassiz and George Berkeley he
gives this just tribute to Agassiz:</p>

<p>"The writer was a man of transcendent genius for scientific discovery,
with intense earnestness and enthusiasm for the pursuit of truth, and rare
eloquence and literary skill. If any man was devoted to the cause of truth
and determined to accept it, whatever it might prove to be, that man was
Agassiz; for while his impulses were notably devout and reverential, he
proved, on many occasions, that he was fearless and independent in the
search for truth. It is no disparagement to Buckland and Bell and Chalmers
and the other authors of the Bridgewater Treatises to assert that
Agassiz far surpassed them all in acquaintance with the methods which
lead to success in the interpretation of Nature, and in ability to treat the
problems of natural theology from the standpoint of the zo&ouml;logist."</p>

<p>He dedicates his book to Bishop Berkeley, and throughout the lectures
his references indicate a thorough acquaintance with the writings of this
eminent scholar.</p>

<p>Paley's old watch comes in for renewed consideration, and one wonders
if the mainspring of this device will ever be broken. His apt references
to classical authors indicate wide and judicious reading. The book is
overburdened with thought and clear, concise reasoning, and his final
advice should be followed when he urges his readers to do double duty by
reading the book again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the April number (1898) of this magazine we had occasion to review
the first two volumes of this work.<a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a> A perusal of the third volume does not
permit us to modify the expressions and criticisms there made. We then
said the work is "a compact storehouse of facts, a veritable ethnological
museum, and this feature alone renders the book indispensable to American
students." The author "shows no evidence of ever having seen the
magnificent series of volumes issued by the United States Bureau of Ethnology."
"The author in several instances confounds Japan and China."
"His treatment of the African races is by far the most exhaustive." These
extracts will apply most particularly to the present volume. The negro
races of the interior of Africa and those of West Africa, as well as the
cultured races of that continent, are exhaustively treated. In that portion
treating of the history of the civilization of eastern Asia the Japanese and
Chinese are considered together and many mistakes in generalization follow
as a result of this confounding. Long before we get to this portion
of the work an illustration is given of Japanese agricultural instruments,
in which only one plow of the many types in Japan is presented, and this
is evidently taken from a model. Not only has he confounded the Japanese
with the Chinese, but the southern Malays are brought in when he
speaks of the Malay and Japanese love of the cockfight&mdash;a practice which
is unknown in Japan. He refers to the Japanese latrine as being built
over running water, whereas the record of this custom is found only in
an ancient Japanese classic of the seventh century. He is in error in
stating that the stage is essentially the same in China and Japan. His
description of the music of Japan applies to China only. The statements
that pearls play a large part in the ornaments of the Japanese, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
fireproof buildings are of stone, that the Japanese tobacco is moistened
with opium, that the Japanese street dress is full of color, are all erroneous.
His description of the sash worn by men is the description of the woman's
sash. He says "the Japanese currency before the change to dollars and
cents was like that of the Chinese." Had he consulted Snowden's description
of ancient and modern coins, etc., he would have found this correct
statement in regard to Japanese coins: "In their shape, composition, and
relation to each other they present some striking features which set them
apart from every other system of coinage in the world."</p>

<p>The illustrations are badly distributed. Through pages of description
of the Japanese and Koreans, in which little is said about the Koreans,
are scattered illustrations of the inhabitants of Yeso&mdash;the Ainu. The illustration
of Japanese table furniture depicts only utensils for smoking and
wine-drinking, and some of these are erroneously labeled, as are those of
certain Chinese utensils.</p>

<p>We trust that the Asiatic portion of this valuable work will be written
over again, and in doing it the author will realize that he is dealing with
four or five hundred million people widely separated in language, modes
of writing, customs, and manners; that he will consider the Ainu, Korean,
Japanese, Chinese, Thibetan, and Indo-Chinese with the same thoroughness
that he has given to the separate groups of the African continent; that
he will draw his information from modern sources and collections properly
labeled and up to date.</p>

<p>Even with the defects pointed out the work will prove of great value to
the American student, as it brings before him the richness of the ethnological
museums of Europe.</p>


<h3>GENERAL NOTICES.</h3>

<p><i>The Development of English Thought</i><a name="FNanchor_X_24" id="FNanchor_X_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a>
is "an attempt to present a theory of
history through concrete illustrations."
The book does not deal with the facts
of history&mdash;a knowledge of these is assumed&mdash;it
throws into relief certain salient
features of each epoch which were
instrumental in forwarding the social
consciousness. It may, indeed, be called
a philosophy of economics. It has a theory
to propound: Survival is determined
and progress created by a struggle for
the goods for which men strive, or the
means by which they may avert evil.
These goods change, together with the
environment dependent on them. Hence
arise new activities; the race is modified,
new modes of thought come forward,
and finally the characteristics
of the civilization are reconstructed.
These changes are subject to a definite
law of evolution, repeated in each new
environment. England has been chosen
for this economic interpretation of history;
because of its insular position, its
development has been more normal and
indigenous, less subject to foreign influences
since the Reformation, than any
continental country. An explanation of
the psychological theory underlying the
book serves as general introduction.
The antecedents of English thought are
found among the early Germans, and
the Early Church. The fifteenth century,
with its inventions and discoveries,
revolutionized men's ways of living
and thinking. Then the Calvinists and
Puritans imposed their standards of
good and evil. These are followed by
the great English thinkers: Locke, who
marks the beginning of Deism in England;
Mandeville, Hume, and Smith,
developing the economic side; Whitefield
and Wesley leading the religious
revival. Later on, Malthus, Ricardo,
and Mill formulated the Economic Philosophy,
whereas Darwin, the first of
the biologists, imposed biologic habits of
thought on economic inquiry. The concluding
chapter, while cautious in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
discussion of current problems, attempts,
assisted by the lessons of the
past, to indicate the probable future
movement of thought, springing out of
present economic conditions.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Wilbur S. Jackman</i> has sought in
preparing his manual of <i>Nature Study
for Grammar Grades</i>,<a name="FNanchor_Y_25" id="FNanchor_Y_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a> to propose a few
of such problems arising in a thoughtful
study of Nature as are within the
comprehension of grammar-school pupils,
and to offer suggestions designed
to lead to their solution. Directions
may perhaps be given by the teacher&mdash;that
is, by some teachers, but very few&mdash;but
even if he knows how, it is hardly
possible for him to make them as systematic
to so large an extent as would
be required by a school of inquiring
pupils; and such a plan as the author
offers may be accepted as a valuable
help. Take, for instance, the first lesson
on the mutual relations of plants
and insects&mdash;as to plants. The student
is told what equipment to take, what
places to visit; is reminded of seven
kinds of evidence in the shape of galls,
stings, eaten leaves, etc., to be considered;
and is given a list of queries to be
recollected in studying the phenomena,
in their general aspect, as to the benefit
or injury received by the plant from
insects, the attractions it offers, and
the defenses it possesses, with "number
work" relating to the extent of the
depredations, and methods of representing
the results of the study in picture.
The book contains forty-five such lessons
on different aspects of Nature.</p>

<p>In the preparation of his book on
<i>Fertilizers</i><a name="FNanchor_Z_26" id="FNanchor_Z_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a> it has been the aim of Mr.
<i>Voorhees</i> to point out the underlying
principles and to discuss, in the light of
our present knowledge of the subject,
some of the important problems connected
with the use of fertilizing materials.
While the author recognizes the
lack of definite knowledge on many
vital points, he considers it desirable,
when the investigations of the experiment
stations are becoming so important
and they are so well prepared to
study the fundamental principles of
plant nutrition, for the practical man to
have a clear understanding of what is
now known. The book treats of the
natural fertility of the soil and the
sources of the loss of the elements of
fertility, the functions of manure and
fertilizers and the need of artificial ones,
the different classes of fertilizers, the
chemical analysis of them, and the
methods of using them with their special
application to various crops.</p>

<p>We have received, with only a short
interval between them, the first volume
of a third edition and the fourth or
last volume of the second edition of
<i>Alfred H. Allen's Commercial Organic
Analysis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_AA_27" id="FNanchor_AA_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA_27" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a> The former volume is first
to reach us. It is a high testimony to
the value of the work in itself that the
publication of a rival issue of the edition
of 1885 had been begun by another
house, although its age, as suggested by
the date, would indicate that it had
much need of revision. During the thirteen
years since the publication of this
edition later research has thrown new
light on many features of the science
and processes, and has corrected many
of the old conceptions, and the author's
views on some points have changed in
the light of the more recent results, so
that the preparation of a new edition
had become necessary. Mr. Allen has
found it now impossible for him to undertake
the continuous labor which
would be imposed by such a task, and
the work of revision has been undertaken
by Henry Leffmann, of Philadelphia.
For this new edition Mr. Allen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
has furnished material on the subjects
of the Kjeldahl process, proteids of
wheat flour, vinegar, brewing sugars,
malt substitutes, hop substitutes, and
secondary constituents in spirits. Information
has been added by the American
reviser, partly from suggestions by
Mr. Allen on the subjects of specific
gravity, formaldehyde, vinegar, methyl,
alcohol, acetone, fusel oil, argol, starch,
glucose, invert sugar, lactose, and wine,
and brief notes on other topics. Processes
of the American Association of
Official Agricultural Chemists have been
reprinted. The revision of Vol. II is
well in hand, and will be much more
extensive than that of Vol I.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the revision of
the second edition has extended over
fourteen years, and is only just completed
with the fourth volume, which
appears a few weeks later than the volume
noticed above. The earlier volumes
have been long out of print, and are destined,
of course, to be supplanted by
those of the new revision. The present
fourth volume, being newer and of the
present date, will serve as the latest till
the last volume of the new revision is
reached; and, besides, the author hopes
to publish an appendix to each volume,
containing the more important of the
later results. The meaning of the term
Commercial Analysis has been somewhat
extended, and matter has been included
that in closest strictness does not
belong under it, it being thought better,
the author says, to include all facts possessing
an analytical or practical interest
to him, in the belief that what he
finds useful himself will be of value to
others.</p>

<p>In <i>The Porto Rico of To-day</i><a name="FNanchor_AB_28" id="FNanchor_AB_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_AB_28" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a> a traveler's
view of that interesting island and
its people is presented by Mr. <i>A. G. Robinson</i>,
who went there and remained
during August, September, and October,
1898, as correspondent of the New York
Evening Post. While the book can not
be regarded, as it does not profess and
is not intended to be, as a source of
geographical or statistical information,
it admirably fulfills the design of the author
to present a picture of the people
and of the country as he saw them; and
it is a very living picture too. He looked
with a sharp eye, and has recorded what
he saw in graphic style. In the author's
story of his early days of the island we
are made acquainted with the various
names it has had, of which Porto Rico,
or Puerto Rico, is only the latest. The
oldest of the European names appears to
have been Buriqui&eacute;n, in some one of the
dozen or more spellings it has had, one
of them being Bo. It has also been
called La Isla de Carib, San Juan Bautista,
etc. After the account of the author's
first general impressions and experiences
he describes the city of Ponce,
his visit to a coffee district, a number
of typical towns and villages, the journey
from Ponce to San Juan, the highways,
railways&mdash;of which there are one
hundred and forty-three miles in operation
and one hundred and seventy-five
miles under construction&mdash;and a fairly
effective telegraph system, views of the
industrial possibilities and commerce of
the island, with some experiences of military
campaigning.</p>

<p>The publication of the revision which
Mr. <i>Herbert Spencer</i> is making of his
Synthetic Philosophy in order to incorporate
in it as far as may be the results
of more recent advances begins
with the first volume of <i>The Principles
of Biology</i>.<a name="FNanchor_AC_29" id="FNanchor_AC_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_AC_29" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a> The advance during the
last generation, Mr. Spencer thinks,
has been more rapid in the direction
of this science than any other, and
though the hope of bringing a work on
biology at large up to date could not be
rationally entertained at the author's
age and under the existing conditions of
his physical strength, a similar service
to a work on the principles of the science
did not seem impossible. Numerous additions
have been needful. What was
originally said about vital changes of
matter is supplemented by a chapter on
Metabolism. A chapter is added on The
Dynamic Element in Life. The insertion
of some pages on Structure fills a gap
in preceding editions. The revelations
of the microscope on cell life and multiplication
are set forth. A supplementary
chapter on Genesis, Heredity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
Variation gives the results of further
evidence and further thought in that
line, qualifying and developing certain
views enunciated in the first edition.
Various modern ideas are considered
under the title Recent Criticisms and
Hypotheses. The chapter on The Arguments
from Embryology has been largely
rewritten. Smaller additions appear
in the form of new sections incorporated
in pre-existing chapters. The assistance
needed in the work of revision
has been given by Prof. W. H. Perkin
in Organic Chemistry and its derived
subjects; Prof. A. G. Tansley in Plant
Morphology and Physiology; Prof. E.
W. MacBride and Mr. J. T. Cunningham
in Animal Morphology; and Mr.
W. B. Hardy in Animal Physiology. In
all sections not marked as new the author
desires it to be understood that the
essential ideas set forth are the same as
they were in the original edition of 1864.</p>

<p>Prof. <i>Silas W. Holman</i> attempts
the presentation, in <i>Matter, Energy,
Force, and Work</i>,<a name="FNanchor_AD_30" id="FNanchor_AD_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_AD_30" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a> of some of the fundamental
ideas and definitions of physics
in a plain and logical manner. His
purpose is not to set forth the experimental
side of the subject or to describe
phenomena or laws. He rather assumes
a slight knowledge of these, and proceeds
to develop the concept and definitions.
The author regards a clearer
thinking on these subjects as of special
importance to engineers and members of
the other technical professions, because
correct views upon them have become
essential in those professions through
the progress of the applications of science
to the industrial arts. These applications
are likewise of considerable
interest to the untechnical members of
the community. Professor Holman has
composed his book with the principle of
presenting the subject of physics in
logical sequence, and has divided it into
two parts, the first of which contains
the matter immediately proper to the
subject, with discussions of substance
or matter, motion; energy and its
forms; force; kinetic energy, force-measurements,
work, potential energy,
and matter again, as distinguished from
substance. The second part comprises
summaries of the chief theories of the
nature of matter, force, and energy, including
the kinetic theory of gases, Le
Sage's theory of gravitation, the vortex-atom
theory, and a discussion of
the nature of energy and matter, with
observations on chemical energy and
the ether.</p>

<p>The <i>Short Course in Music</i>, prepared
for use in schools where a complete
course is not thought necessary, by <i>F.
H. Ripley</i> and <i>Thomas Tappen</i>, is embraced
in two books, of which we notice
the second (American Book Company).
Familiar songs are made the basis of
instruction, some of those which appear
as melodies in Book One being repeated
here in full score. All other material
has been prepared especially for this
book. The music and directions are
adapted equally for unchanged and
changed voices. Voice training and the
elements of phrasing and expression are
furnished in a group of <i>solfeggios</i> at the
close of the book. Theory is given in
condensed form, but one that, it is
claimed, embraces all the essential elements
of vocal music.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>J. E. Marr</i> has prepared his exposition
of <i>The Principles of Stratigraphical
Geology</i> (Cambridge University
Press; The Macmillan Company,
New York, $1.60), under the belief that
an idea of the subject can be obtained
most satisfactorily if a large number of
the details connected with the study of
the stratified rocks are omitted. He has
accordingly given very brief accounts
of the strata of the different systems,
paying more attention to the bearings
of the facts than to their enumeration.
The history of the earth is presented as
a connected one, in which one period is
linked on to the next, every event that
occurs introducing a new complication
into the conditions, which are consequently
never quite the same&mdash;the
changes showing an advance from the
simple to the more complex. The study
proves that an enormous period elapsed
subsequent to the formation of the
earth and previous to the deposition of
the stratified rocks, of which we have
only the slightest, if any, knowledge.
The stratigraphical geologist has to establish
the order of succession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
strata for the chronology, and to ascertain
as far as he can the conditions existing
during the deposition of the several
strata or groups of strata. After
an account of the growth and progress
of stratigraphical geology, the nature of
the stratified rocks and the law of superposition
are discussed; the test of
included organisms and the methods
of classification are explained, the evidences
of conditions under which strata
were formed, and other theoretical points
are considered, and the several geological
systems or periods are enumerated
under the English nomenclature. Finally,
the various estimates of geological
time and the bases on which they are
made are reviewed.</p>

<p>The American Book Company publishes
as a part of the Eclectic System of
Industrial Drawing an excellent manual
of the <i>Elements of Perspective</i>, by
<i>Christine Gordon Sullivan</i>, of the Cincinnati
public schools. It consists of explicit
directions and rules on the general
principles of the art, with applications
in Isometric Projection and
Oblique Perspective, given in concise
form and simple, clear language, amply
illustrated, and supplemented by problems,
in solving which the rules are made
practical.</p>

<p>A convenient manual on <i>Gas and
Petroleum Engines</i> has been prepared
by <i>A. G. Elliott</i> from the French of
<i>Henry de Graffigny</i> for Whittaker's
Electro-Mechanical Series, in recognition
of the interest that has been awakened
in the application of such engines to
supply the place now occupied by horses
in drawing vehicles. One chapter deals
exclusively with the theory of the gas
engines. Other topics treated of are the
history of the gas engine, the description
of existing gas engines, carbureted
air engines, petroleum engines, gas-generating
plants, engines for use with poor
gases, and the maintenance of gas and
oil engines. (The Macmillan Company,
75 cents.)</p>

<p><i>Laboratory Exercises in Anatomy
and Physiology</i> (New York: Henry
Holt &amp; Co., 60 cents) have been prepared
by <i>James Edward Peabody</i> for
practical application. The precept is
emphasized that the pupil should be
led to see that most of the materials required
for observation and experiment
are furnished by the organs and tissues
of his own body. Directions which have
been found in the author's experience
necessary to guide the pupil in his observations
and experiments are given
at the beginning of each topic. The
questions following them contemplate
the student's seeking the facts from the
material itself, and he is expected to be
trained to distinguish observed results
from the inferences that may be drawn
from them. Some home study is contemplated,
the results to be afterward
reported in class. The book consists almost
entirely of directions for experiments,
and is interlined with blank
sheets for recording observations.</p>

<p><i>Geographical Nature Studies</i> (American
Book Company) is intended by the
author, <i>Frank Owen Payne</i>, to assist
the teacher, and by pointing out the relations,
often unrecognized, between familiar
phenomena and home geography
to guide the study of the class to definite
and practical ends. The lessons are
intended to fit the comprehension of the
youngest pupils, to promote the cultivation
of habits of accurate observation,
and to stimulate a desire for more
knowledge and broader views of the
world. They lead directly up to the
point where the more formal study of
geography from a text-book begins.
The lessons may be used as reading exercises
and for topical recitations, and
exercises are introduced which may assist
the cultivation of the power of correct
verbal expression in the statement
of facts. The exercises concern weather,
animals, physical phenomena, and objects
about us, and are very various.</p>

<p>Impressions of Medus&aelig; have been
observed on the Jurassic lithographic
limestones of Solenhofen, and some
"problematic fossils" on the Lower
Cambrian rocks of Sweden have been
regarded as derived from Medus&aelig;. Certain
nodules, bearing what looked like
flattened-out starfishes&mdash;"star-cobbles"
they were called&mdash;have been found
among the fossils of the Coosa Valley,
Alabama. Director <i>Charles D. Walcott</i>,
of the United States Geological Survey,
concluded that these also represented
Medus&aelig;, and began an investigation of
them which involved a comparison with
the Swedish and Bavarian specimens,
and was at last enlarged so as to embrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
all fossil Medus&aelig;. His work is now
published as a separate memoir, <i>Fossil
Medus&aelig;</i>, as one of the Monographs of
the United States Geological Survey
(Vol. XXX). The Middle Cambrian Medus&aelig;
are first described, and then, in
order, the Lower Cambrian of the United
States and of Sweden and Bohemia and
the Jurassic of Bavaria. The text is
illustrated by forty-seven excellent
plates.</p>

<p>A new edition, revised and with additions,
of the <i>Mechanics</i> and <i>Heat</i> of
<i>Edward L. Nichols</i> and <i>W. S. Francis</i> is
published by the Macmillan Company
($1.50). The book is the first volume of
the Elements of Physics of the authors,
which is complete in three volumes. We
find in it no explanation of the nature
and extent of the revisions and additions.</p>

<p>The publication of such a book as
<i>Catering for Two</i>&mdash;Comfort and Economy
for small Households (G. P. Putnam's
Sons, $1.25)&mdash;has been suggested
to <i>Alice L. James</i> by the difficulty of
reducing the average rules of the cook-book
to meet the wants of a family of
two or three. The work embodies the
results of sixteen years' experience in
labor and study, and the author hopes
that with it the way may be made easier
for others whose bills of fare may
be made for two. The directions are
claimed to be throughout exact and reliable,
and the dishes to be nourishing,
appetizing, and inexpensive. The author's
plan is to take a bill of fare with
a comfortable variety of dishes, and
direct explicitly how each is to be prepared.</p>

<p>The manual on <i>Testing Milk and its
Products</i>, prepared for dairy students,
creamery and cheese factory operators,
food chemists, and dairy farmers, by
<i>E. H. Farrington</i> and <i>F. W. Noll</i>, has
reached a fourth edition, the first three
editions having been exhausted in about
a year. The present edition has been
thoroughly revised, and such additions
have been made to it as have been necessary
to bring it up to date. It has been
adopted as a text-book or reference-book
in the dairy schools of twelve States of
the Union and in a number of schools
in Canada. (Published by the Mendota
Book Company, Madison, Wis. $1.)</p>

<p><i>The Silver Cross, or the Carpenter
of Nazareth</i> (International Publishing
Company, New York), is a short story
selected and translated from The Mysteries
of the People of Eug&egrave;ne Sue, and
published for the sake of the illustrations
it is supposed to afford of the
tyranny of the ruling class and the oppression
of the working people and the
poor and their suffering thereby which
prevailed in the grand days of the Roman
Empire, as well as always before,
and is assumed to have continued down
to the present. It is the story of the life
and sufferings of Jesus of Nazareth, told
in the thrilling style of the great French
novelist.</p>

<h2>Fragments of Science.</h2>


<p><b>The New Zealand Experiment in
Woman Suffrage.</b>&mdash;The right of suffrage
was given to all the women of
New Zealand in 1893 without any concerted
action or aggressive demonstrations
on their part by the free, almost
unsolicited, vote of the men. The general
election took place in November of
the same year, and is described in the
Saturday Review as having been a
warm contest, with several questions
on which public opinion was sharply divided;
but "on the whole, the women
took matters wonderfully coolly. They
flocked in thousands to the public meetings,
where, by common consent, the
front seats were given up to them."
Contrary to expectation, they displayed
little emotion, and even had to be
"coached" to make a pretense of enthusiasm.
"Polling day was awaited
with dread by the electioneering agents
and returning officers, with doubt by
veteran politicians, and with pleasurable
excitement by the women." They
all voted, and "what did it all lead
to?" "It left things very much as
they were.... Gradually but irresistibly
the conviction forced itself upon
the New Zealand mind that the women
knowing little and caring as little
about political details, had voted almost
always with the men of their family
and class. Sharing to the full the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
prejudices, hopes, and interests of their
fathers, brothers, husbands, and lovers,
they had cheerfully doubled the voting
power of these. Where, as in the case
of schoolmistresses and factory girls,
they had some special bond of union
other than domestic they had voted
very much as schoolmasters and male
trade-unionists had voted.... With
one accord colonists ceased to be afraid
of what the suffrage might do, and
began instead to complain of it for not
doing more. Only here and there careful
observers note that groups of women
are studying politics, and foresee
that, as years go by, these will supply a
new and intelligent force with distinct
and logically reasoned aims of its own."</p>

<p><b>The Metric System</b> (a Letter to the
London Times).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I see that on
Wednesday next, the 22d inst., the
President of the Board of Trade is to receive
a deputation from the Decimal Associations
and others to urge on the
Government, not merely the adoption
of the decimal system of notation, but
the compulsory application within two
years of the metric system of weights
and measures in its entirety. I have
been hoping to see a letter in the Times
from some person of importance calling
attention to this deputation. I fervently
trusted I should notice one from
your correspondent, Mr. Herbert Spencer,
who, a year or so back, contributed
a series of thoroughly well-thought-out
and logical articles, exposing the fallacy
of the metric system; but if any
such letter has appeared I have, unfortunately,
missed it. I believe this agitation
to be largely due to scientific professors
who have been brought up on
foreign books, and have found it too
much trouble to convert foreign measurements
into English; further, due to
the promptings of a number of foreign
merchants, forming (happily, or unhappily)
now so large a portion of our
traders-men who, also, do not wish to
take the trouble of converting foreign
weights and measures into English. As
regards the suggestion, made time after
time, that the metric system is one giving
the greatest simplicity to calculations,
I say unhesitatingly, from very
considerable experience, that it is one
absolutely subversive of mental arithmetic,
and I appeal to anybody who has
ever had the misfortune to wait at the
<i>guichet</i> of a French railway station
while the clerk inside has been calculating
the total amount to be paid for
two first-class and one second-class from
"A" to "B" with a piece of chalk, or
pencil and paper, to compare the speed
and the certainty of this process with
the answer that he would get at Euston,
or at any such station in Great Britain,
and say which system shows by results
the advantages in point of time and in
accuracy. The French themselves, as
has been pointed out on more than one
occasion, find the metric system too irksome,
and they evade it. According to
the metric system, one of its great merits
is that you can state every required
quantity by multiples or submultiples
of ten&mdash;metre, 1; decimetre, 0.1; centimetre,
0.01; millimetre, 0.001. But no
Frenchman thinks of expressing himself
in this way. Instead of 0.01, he says
cm. 1. For a millimetre, he says mm. 1.
When he comes to large weights, does
he not commonly abjure the 1,000 kilos
and write one tonne? When he comes
to domestic weights the kilogramme is
found too large; the half of this, the
practical equivalent of the pound, is
wanted. He ought to write 500
grammes. He does not. He abjures
his decimals, and writes one half kilo.
But I feel I must not take up your space
by multiplying instances, so well known
to many who have studied the subject,
of the unbearable burden of the decimal
<i>plus</i> metrical system compulsorily carried
out. I well know the value of decimals,
and the indispensable need of their
use in many circumstances; but I object
to being compelled to use them when
they are not needed and are in the way.
I find it easier to state seven eighths, and
to deal with it mentally, than to put it
into the form of .875. I do not wish to
be restricted by law in the use of my
tools. What would be thought of the
law which compelled a shipwright on
all occasions to use a chisel, and never
to employ the adze. I, with, I believe,
every upholder of English weights and
measures, and of the use of fractions,
am quite willing that the metric system
should be made legal in its entirety
throughout Great Britain; but we are
not willing that the useful weights and
measures which we can employ with so
great facility and accuracy should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
made illegal. Let the two exist together,
and experience will prove which
is the one preferred by the community.
I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<span style="margin-right: 5em;"><i>March 18, 1899</i>.</span></p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;Very probably the old stalking-horses
will be trotted out on
Wednesday, and the President of the
Board of Trade will be told of the confusion
created by the existence of mere
local weights and measures. I believe
that if those who cite these anomalies
were asked to give instances at various
dates it would be found that these local
weights and measures were dying out.
In any event they are illegal, and are
not obligatory upon anybody. Every
man can claim to deal according to the
standards of length, of weights, and of
capacity. Most certainly the introduction
of the metric system would largely
add to the use of illegal weights and
measures, not only locally, but generally.
If the inquiry were made in
France, even no farther off than Boulogne,
it would be found that, in the
markets there, dealings are frequently
carried out on a local system unconnected
with the metric.&mdash;F. B.</p>

<p><b>Variations in African Religious
Ideas.</b>&mdash;Miss Kingsley observes, in her
West African Studies, that when you
are traveling from district to district
you can not fail to be struck by the
difference in character of the native religions
you are studying, and that no
wandering student of the subject in
western Africa can avoid recognizing
the existence of at least four distinct
forms of development of the fetich idea.
They have every one of them the same
underlying idea, and yet they differ.
"And I believe," Miss Kingsley says,
"much of the confusion which is supposed
to exist in African religious ideas
is a confusion only existing in the minds
of cabinet ethnologists from a want of
recognition of the fact of the existence
of these schools. For example, suppose
you take a few facts from Ellis and a
few from Bastian and mix, and call the
mixture West African religion. You do
much the same sort of thing as if you
took bits from Mr. Spurgeon's works
and from those of some eminent Jesuit
and of a sound Greek churchman
and mixed them, and labeled it European
religion. The bits would be all
right by themselves, but the mixture
would be a quaint affair." Of the four
main schools of fetich predicated by
Miss Kingsley, the Tshi and Ewe school
(Ellis's school) is mainly concerned
with the preservation of life; the Calabar
school with attempting to enable
the soul successfully to pass through
death; the Mpongwe school with the attainment
of material prosperity; and
the school of Nkissi with the worship
of the mystery of the power of evil.</p>

<p><b>A Natural History Society as a
School.</b>&mdash;Among the agencies employed
by the Boston Society of Natural History
for making itself a vehicle of instruction
to the public has been the employment
of an educated man and teacher
as guide to the museum, who should
also give lectures there. The salary of
this officer has heretofore been provided
by the bounty of Miss Harriet E. Freeman,
but she has been obliged to discontinue
her contribution, and the curator
is now seeking other means of maintaining
a suitably qualified assistant. The
"guide," Mr. A. W. Grabau, delivered
a course of lectures in April and May,
1897, on "The Surface of the Earth: Its
Rocks, Soil, and Scenery," in which special
attention was given to the scenery
in New England; and, whenever it was
practicable, excursions were made to localities
which could be used as illustrations.
A similar course, delivered in
1896, resulted in the formation during
the summer of the same year of a class of
thirty persons, summer residents of Kennebunkport,
Maine, who were under
Mr. Grabau's daily instruction for two
weeks. The awakening of interest in
local scenery further led to his giving
lectures in Belmont and Arlington, and
he thereby became instrumental in a
movement intended to preserve the local
frontal bowlder moraine on Arlington
Heights&mdash;a valuable geological
movement. A course of lectures on the
Animals of the Shores of New England
was given by Mr. Grabau to a class of
from forty to seventy-five persons, in
the Teachers' School of Science, with
excursions on Wednesday and Saturday
afternoons. In a similar fall course attention
was given specially to the study
of animals in their various habitats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
A course by Mr. Grabau on the use of
the microscope and the preparation of
specimens was followed by ten days'
laboratory work in Limekilns Bay,
Maine. One of the results of a winter
course on zo&ouml;logy, to a class of twenty
teachers, was the formation of the Hale
House Natural History Club, in connection
with which field meetings are held,
classes for children are formed, and
papers upon elementary subjects are
read and discussed. Other courses of
lectures are mentioned in the report of
the curator of the society&mdash;the field lessons
in geology, by Professor Barton,
with a winter course in historical geology;
the course of Dr. R. W. Greenleaf,
on the elementary structure and function
of the parts of flowering plants;
the course of the curator (Alpheus
Hyatt), on elementary zo&ouml;logy; and the
lectures on geography, by Prof. W. M.
Davis.</p>

<p><b>Glacier Water.</b>&mdash;An analysis of
two samples of water from the Illecilliwaet
Glacier, in British Columbia, was
recently made by F. T. Shutt and A. T.
Charron. The water was collected a few
feet from the glacier's irregular face,
about a mile and a half from the glacier
station on the Canadian Pacific Railway.
The following is abstracted from
an account in the Chemical News:</p>

<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>The authors go on to say: "From
the above data we may unhesitatingly
conclude that the glacier water is one
of great organic purity. The samples
are not identical, due no doubt to the
fact that they were collected twelve
days apart, and probably from different
parts of the foot of the glacier.
Both analyses, however, show that,
judged by the standards used in the
diagnosis of ordinary potable waters, it
is a water possessing a high degree of
purity, and one perfectly wholesome
and eminently suited for drinking and
household purposes. As received, both
samples were quite murky, almost
milky, in appearance. On allowing
them to stand, perfect subsidence took
place, leaving the supernatant water
colorless and brilliant. A microscopic
examination of the sediment showed
it to consist of very fine rock matter,
chiefly fragments of quartzite.</p>

<p><b>Protection of Plants and Birds
in France and Italy.</b>&mdash;Organized
efforts for the protection of native
plants and birds from further destruction
are multiplying in Europe. Botanical
stations for Alpine plants have
been established at several places in
France and Switzerland, and now Italy
has come into line with the association
<i>Pro Mortibus</i>, which, founded in July,
1897, has already more than five hundred
adherents. Italy is probably the
country where work of this kind is
most needed, for nowhere else is the destruction,
particularly of birds, so systematically,
persistently, and industriously
carried on. <i>Pro Mortibus</i> will
also interest itself in the preservation
and replantation of the forests. Among
other efforts looking in a similar direction,
M. J. Corcelli tells in <i>La Nature</i>
of the establishment of shelters in connection
with the schools in Saxony
where birds are fed in the winter, and
of lessons given to the children inculcating
regard for them. A great deal
has been accomplished in France without
much noise in rewooding the devastated
slopes of the mountains and
erecting efficient safeguards against
ravage by torrents&mdash;largely by restraining
the torrents at their sources; and
the Alpine forests of the country, M.
Corcelli says, "are again rising from
their ashes." Reserves of Alpine plants
have been established by the Belfort
section of the French Alpine Club on
the <i>Ballon</i> of Alsace; the central section
is creating an extensive botanical
garden in the Vosges, to serve as a place
of refuge and propagation and multiplication
of species threatened with extinction.
The city of Annecy, in Savoy,
has recently voted the money required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
for establishing a similar garden on
the verdant ridges of the Semnoz. Two
local societies in Italy are engaged in
a similar work, one of which has established
the garden museum Chamousia
on the slopes of the Saint Bernard,
where plants from the Pyrenees and the
Himalaya are also collected. Switzerland
is not behind either of these countries
in this work.</p>

<p><b>Tortoise Shell.</b>&mdash;The following interesting
account of the tortoise-shell
industry is taken from Nature: The tortoise
shell of commerce is obtained from
the horny superficial plates overlying the
bony case of the great majority of tortoises
and turtles. Turtles differ from
tortoises in the heart-shaped form of the
upper half of the shell, and the conversion
of the limbs into paddles adapted
for swimming. The upper part of the
shell carries a median row of five large
superficial horny plates, flanked on either
side by a row of four or five still
larger flat plates; these thirteen or fifteen
large plates affording some of the
most valuable commercial tortoise shell
in the particular species whose shell is in
most demand. On the front and hind
edges of the upper bony shell and the
portion connecting the latter with the
plastron, or lower shell, are a series of
smaller horny plates, generally twenty-four
in number, which are sharply bent
in the middle and are known in the
trade as "hoof." The under surface of
the shell of a turtle carries six pairs of
large, more or less flat, horny plates,
for which the trade term, derived from
their uniform color, is "yellow belly."
In value they sometimes exceed all but
the very finest of the large upper plates,
generally known simply as "shell." Of
the host of land and fresh-water tortoises,
most of which are of comparatively
small size, the horny plates
(which, by the way, are altogether
wanting in the so-called soft tortoises
of tropical rivers), on account of their
thinness and opacity, are now of no
commercial value, at least in England.
Moreover, it is by no means all species
of marine turtles which yield commercial
tortoise shell. Of these marine
turtles, exclusive of the great leathery
turtle, there are three well-marked and
perfectly distinct types, severally represented
by the green or edible turtle,
the hawksbill, and the loggerhead.
The hawksbill furnishes the most valuable
shell. The largest and best plates,
which are in the middle of the back,
are about a quarter of an inch thick
in the center, and measure about thirteen
by eight inches, their weight being
from about half a pound each to as much
as one pound. The length of the carapace
(the upper shell) in the hawksbill
is about forty-two inches. It is
found in all tropical and subtropical
seas. From a dead turtle the plates
of tortoise shell can be readily detached
by beating. The highest price realized
during 1898 in the London market was
about 112<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (about $28) a pound
for the very best selected shell. It is
stated that 76,760 pounds of hawksbill
shell were sold in London in 1898.
The shell is very readily workable, being
made partially plastic by immersion in
hot water.</p>

<p><b>Poison in Wild Cherry Leaves.</b>&mdash;Instances

College Agricultural Experiment
Station of cattle presumably fatally poisoned
by prussic acid from eating wild
cherry leaves, the subject has been investigated
by Fred W. Morse and
Charles D. Howard. Five species of
wild cherry grow in New Hampshire, of
which the red cherry and the horse plum
are not regarded as dangerous, and the
dwarf cherry has not been examined,
but is strongly suspected. The wild
black cherry is the most noxious species,
and the chokecherry is not far behind
it. The poisonous principle in these
cherries is hydrocyanic or prussic acid,
which, however, does not exist in the
leaves as such, but is derived from the
amygdalin they contain. The popular
opinion that only the wilted leaves are
specially dangerous is not borne out.
The authors found both wilted and fresh
leaves poisonous, and the dried leaves
worthy to be regarded with suspicion.
Vigorous, succulent leaves from young
shoots, which are the ones most likely
to be eaten by cattle, are far more poisonous
than the leaves from a mature
tree or stunted shrub. The largest
amounts of prussic acid were derived
from leaves wilted in bright sunlight to
about seventy-five per cent their original
weight, or till they began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
appear slightly limp and lose their gloss.
Leaves wilted in the dark were much
less dangerous.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Brinton's Contributions to
American Linguistics.</b>&mdash;At the suggestion
of the late James Constantine
Pilling, Dr. D. G. Brinton has prepared
an analytical survey of his contributions
in the field of American linguistics,
which have now extended over forty
years. The list includes seventy-one
titles of books and papers, of which sixteen
are classed as general articles and
works. The first four of these are occupied
with the inquiry whether the
native American languages, as a group,
have peculiar morphological traits that
justify their classification as one of the
great divisions of human speech. Dr.
Brinton finds a feature&mdash;incorporation&mdash;which,
under the form polysynthesis, is
present in a marked degree in nearly
all of them. Another paper shows that
the various alleged affiliations between
American and Asiatic tongues are wholly
unfounded, and another pleads for more
attention to American languages. A
volume of nearly four hundred pages&mdash;The
American Race&mdash;was the first attempt
at a systematic classification of
all the tribes of North, Central, and
South America on the basis of language.
It defines seventy-nine linguistic
stocks in North America and sixty-one
in South America, pertaining to
nearly sixteen hundred tribes. Other
volumes in the list include writings, preferably
on secular subjects, by natives
in their own languages. One contains
a list of native American authors, and
notices some of their works. Another
vindicates the claim of native American
poetry to recognition. These works
were followed by the Library of Aboriginal
American Literature, of which eight
considerable volumes were published,
each containing a work wholly of native
inspiration, in a native tongue, with
a translation, notes, etc. Fourteen other
publications relate to North American
languages north of Mexico, thirty-two
to Mexican and Central American languages,
and ten to South American and
Antillean languages. Many of these articles
were collected in 1890 and published
in a volume entitled Essays of an
Americanist. It was arranged in four
parts, relating respectively to Ethnology
and Arch&aelig;ology, Mythology and
Folklore, Graphic Systems and Literature,
and Linguistics. The value of Dr.
Brinton's labors will be realized by all
persons who know how rapidly things
purely native American are passing
away.</p>

<p><b>Metallic Alloys of Rich Colors.</b>&mdash;A
remarkable alloy of gold seventy-eight
parts and aluminum twenty-two
parts, discovered by Messrs. Roberts-Austen
and Hunt, has a characteristic
purple color which can not be imitated;
for if the designated proportions of the
constituents are varied from, the base is
entirely changed. The compound lacks
somewhat in the qualities of resistance
and malleability. The color is abnormal
in that it partakes of none of the
color features of its constituents, as is
the case in most combinations of metals.
Thus, the colors of copper alloyed with
zinc or tin pass gradually from red to
white, according to the proportions of
the constituent metals. In the union of
two metals of white or bluish-white color,
like zinc, tin, silver, and aluminum,
the color of the alloys is not perceptibly
different from that of the components&mdash;that
is, it continues white. The purple
of the gold aluminum alloy is not, however,
the only exception to this rule.
Aluminum gives highly colored compounds
with several other metals, even
when the second metal is clearly white.
In the experiments of Charles Marcot, of
Geneva, in alloying aluminum with platinum,
palladium, nickel, and cobalt,
combination took place abruptly at red
heat, with the development of an intense
temperature and a partial combination
of the aluminum; and when
platinum is the second metal, an explosion
is liable to occur. An alloy of seventy-two
parts of platinum and twenty-eight
of aluminum had a bright golden
or yellow color, which varied under
slight changes in the proportions of the
elements to violet green or coppery red.
The alloy is hard and brittle and of
crystalline structure. The yellow form
is stable, while the other forms decompose
in a short time. An alloy of seventy-two
parts palladium and twenty-eight
aluminum is of fine coppery rose
color, crystalline texture, hard and brittle,
and suffers no change with time.
An alloy of from seventy-five to eighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
parts cobalt and twenty to twenty-five
aluminum is straw-yellow, inclining to
brown; when just formed it is externally
hard and scratches glass, but is
easily broken with a hammer, and falls
to a powder in a few days. An alloy of
eighty-two parts nickel and eighteen
aluminum has a pronounced straw-yellow
color, is as hard as tempered steel,
and resists the blow of a hammer. The
fracture, close-grained, is that of steel
or bell metal. It is susceptible of a fine
polish, is stable, and keeps its color.
Though interesting on account of their
colors, these alloys, except that of nickel,
are not suitable for any use.</p>

<p><b>The Chemistry of Sausages.</b>&mdash;The
<i>Lancet</i> is authority for the following:
"The composition of the sausage is
not only complex, but it is often obscure.
It is supposed to be a compound
of minced beef and pork. Abroad, however,
the sausage is compounded of a
much wider range of substances. These
include brains, liver, and horseflesh.
Occasionally they do not contain meat
at all, but only bread tinged with red
oxide of iron and mixed with a varying
proportion of fat. Horseflesh is rich in
glycogen, and this fact enables its presence
in sausage meat to be detected
with some amount of certainty. The
test, which depends on a color reaction,
with iodine has recently been more carefully
studied and with more satisfactory
results, so that the presence of five
per cent of horseflesh can be detected.
At present there is no legal provision
for a standard in regard to the composition
of sausages, but clearly there
ought to be. Limitations should be laid
down as to the amount of bread used,
as to the actual proportion of meat substances
present, and as to the coloring
matters added to give an attractive appearance
of fresh meat. Sausages are
extremely liable to undergo decomposition
and become poisonous, owing to
the elaboration of toxic substances during
the putrefactive process. Bad or
rancid fat is very liable to alter the
character of a sausage for the worse.
Thus in some instances the use of rancid
lard has rendered the sausage after a
time quite phosphorescent, an appearance
which indicates, of course, an undesirable
change. The smoked sausage
is a much safer article of diet than the
unsmoked, since the curing process
preserves the meat substance against
decomposition by reason of the empyreumatic
bodies present in the wood smoke
which is used for this purpose."</p>

<p><b>Photographing Papuan Children.</b>&mdash;Many
savages dislike to have
their pictures taken, some being
restrained by motives of superstition; but
in New Guinea Professor Semon found
being photographed a great joke for all
the boys and girls. He had much trouble
in isolating a single individual, so
as not to get thirty or forty persons
into his picture instead of the one he
wished to immortalize. "Wishing," he
says, "to portray one young girl of
uncommonly good looks, I separated her
from the rest, gave her a favorable position,
and adjusted the lens, surrounded
all the while by a crowd of people
behind and beside me, the children
cheering, the women most ardently
attentive, the men benevolently smiling.
Evidently my subject was proud of the
distinction she enjoyed and the attention
vouchsafed her. Quite suddenly,
however, this simple savage, untaught
as she was and innocent of the laws of
reticence and prudishness, became convulsed
with shame, covered her eyes
with her hands, and valiantly resisted
every attempt to make her stand
forward as before. At the same time I
noticed that the hue of her features
changed, the brown of her face becoming
darker and deeper than before, a
phenomenon easily explained by the fact
of the blood rising into her head. Had
she been a brown girl we would have
said that she blushed. At all events,
the physiological process was the same
as that which forces us to blush." At
another time, when the author had got
two little girls into position to be
photographed, their mothers came up and
forbade his taking them that day, but
promised to present them on the morrow.
On the next day "both the little
angels were solemnly brought to meet
us nearly smothered in ornaments, their
hair decorated with feathers and combs,
their ears with tortoise-shell pieces,
their little throats surrounded by plates
of mother-of-pearl and chains of dingo
teeth, legs and arms hung with rings
and shells, teeth, and all sorts of
network.... Here, again, one may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
see that mothers are made of the same
stuff all over the world, Papuan mammas
being equal to any of our peasant
women or fine ladies in the point of
vanity as far as concerns their children."</p>

<p><b>Meat Extracts.</b>&mdash;An interesting account
of the history and preparation of
meat extracts was recently given as a
lecture before the Society of Arts (English)
by Charles R. Valentine. The idea
of concentrating the body of an ox into
a thimbleful of elixir seems to have been
a very old one. Until the work of Justus
von Liebig, about fifty years ago,
however, little progress of practical
value was made toward this end. Liebig
macerated finely divided beef in
cold water, or in water not above 150&deg;
F. The water dissolved from sixteen to
twenty-four per cent of the weight of
the dry flesh. This infusion was heated,
the albumen and red coloring matter of
the blood coagulated, and was separated
as a flocculent precipitate. The remaining
solution has the aromatic taste
and all the properties of soup made by
boiling the flesh. The infusion was
then evaporated at a gentle heat. The
residue amounted to about twelve or
thirteen per cent of the original (dry)
flesh. This is in rough outline the process
of meat-extract making. This extract
is simply an evaporated beef tea,
containing the extractive matters of
beef, and in virtue of these possesses
medicinal and dietetic properties of
value. But it is in no sense a substitute
for beef, as the latter's most important
food constituent&mdash;albumen&mdash;it does
not contain.</p>


<h3>MINOR PARAGRAPHS.</h3>

<p>It appears from tables of Some Statistics
of Engineering Education, compiled
by President M. E. Wadsworth,
of the Michigan College of Mines, that
such education has been, in the United
States, on the whole a thing of comparatively
recent date, the oldest school,
the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,
having been established in 1824; the
next, the Lawrence and Sheffield
Schools, in 1846 and 1847; and the Columbia
School in 1863. Civil engineering
has led in this country, and has had
various periods of advance, as in 1887-'88,
and depression, as in 1896-'97. Mechanical
engineering progressed till
1886-'87, when the number of students
fell off, and the same happened with
electrical engineering, "which further
suffers a natural reaction from having
been greatly overdone." As a rule,
most of the schools in the United States
seem to run to specialties, one or two
of the courses being usually more conspicuous
than the others.</p>

<p>The importance of some arrangement
by which vessels may be informed
of each other's approach in fog and darkness
has given rise to many devices;
the only one, however, which has as yet
proved practical is the fog-horn or siren,
and this has many disadvantages. Several
fatal collisions at sea during the
past year have given rise to renewed
interest in the subject, and a number of
new methods have been suggested. M.
Branley, a French physicist, in a note
presented to the French Academy suggests
that each vessel be provided with
a number of extremely sensitive magnetic
receivers, or coherers, and a powerful
magnetic transmitter. Periodical
signals being made with the transmitter,
corresponding impressions would
be made upon the receivers of approaching
vessels. The principal difficulty
with this scheme lies in the fact that
the receivers of a vessel will be affected
by its own transmitter. There are several
methods by which this difficulty
may be overcome, however. Different
signals may be employed, or the interval
between signals may be regularly
varied. M. Branley calls attention to
the influence of a metallic envelope
surrounding a coherer, and shows that
when the coherer is thus completely
surrounded it is unaffected by the influence
of a transmitter. By thus inclosing
the receiver on a ship at the
instant of the operation of the transmitter
of the same vessel, the above difficulty
might be avoided.</p>

<p>While we can not collect roses from
our gardens in January and maple blossoms
from the woods in February, yet,
as Prof. W. J. Beal shows in a bulletin
of the Michigan Agricultural College<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Experiment Station, our trees and
shrubs in their winter garb furnish excellent
lessons for the profitable employment
of pupils during many weeks at
that season in true botanical study.
"Let each member of a class be provided
with a branch, a foot or two long, from
a sugar maple, and then spend some
ten to twenty minutes or more quietly
looking at the buds and the bark, with
its scars and specks, and then tell what
he has discovered, venturing to explain
the object or meaning of some of the
things he has seen. In a similar manner
let each look over a branch of
beech and then point out the difference
between the two kinds." Opening buds
of trees may be obtained at any time
during the winter by placing the lower
end of the stem in water for a week or
two while in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>Eivind Astrup, in his book With
Peary near the Pole, gives admiring pictures
of the natural innocence of the
uncontaminated Eskimos of northern
Greenland, where are communities in
which "money is unknown, and love of
one's neighbor is a fundamental rule of
action; where theft is not practiced."
All things are held in common, and
falsehoods are told only to spare the
feelings of the listener. Among the instances
of the native kindliness of these
people is one where a dog had eaten up
a reindeer coat, yet was only remonstrated
with by its owner. When the
author suggested that a hungry dog
should be punished for stealing a piece
of blubber, the owner said that it was
himself who deserved the thrashing for
not having obtained sufficient food for
the dog.</p>

<p>The operations of the Illinois State
Laboratory of Natural History during
1897 and 1898 were almost wholly connected
with the work of the State Entomologist
or with that of the Biological
Station. The former work related
to various insects injurious to crops.
The operations of the Biological Station
were carried on with more reference to
completing a formal report upon the
fishes of Illinois. The work is conducted
with a view to the acquisition of correct
ideas of the relative abundance
and local distribution of species, their
haunts, habits, regular migrations, and
irregular movements, their building
times and places, rate of growth, food,
diseases, and enemies&mdash;and, in short,
the whole economy of each kind represented
at the station and of the whole
assemblage taken together as a community
group. Extensive studies of aquatic
entomology were made, and a paper
on ephemerids and dragon flies is nearly
ready for the press. No part of the
work of the station, however, attracts
more attention among scientific men, or
is likely to lead to more interesting and
important results, than the plankton
work, or the systematic study of the
minute forms of plant and animal life
suspended in the water. Water analyses
have been extensively made in connection
with these studies, which, combined
with the continuous biological
work, will, when generalized, furnish a
substantial and authoritative body of
knowledge of the conditions of the waters
of the middle Illinois previous to
the opening of the Chicago drainage
canal, useful for comparison with the
results of similar studies made after
that event. A summer school was conducted,
with fifteen pupils, in 1898, and
publications were issued.</p>


<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>The Pasteur monument was dedicated
at Lille, France, the city in which
the subject of the memorial performed
his earlier more important researches,
April 9th. The ceremony was witnessed
by a large assembly, which included
many eminent scientific men of France
and foreign countries, among whom
men engaged in similar researches to
Pasteur's were especially represented.
The monument, the fruit of a public
subscription, represents Pasteur standing
on the summit of a column of Soignies
stone, holding in his right hand an
experimental flask. At the foot of the
column a woman presents her child,
which has been bitten by a mad dog, for
treatment. To the left is a group representing
inoculation&mdash;a woman, personifying
science, injecting serum into
a child she holds on her knees. Three
bas-reliefs represent respectively Dr.
Roux inoculating a sheep for anthrax,
Pasteur studying fermentation, and the
first antirabic inoculation of the young
Joseph Meister, who is held by his
mother, wearing the broad-flapped Alsatian
bonnet. The statue is in light
bronze, and with the gilded bas-reliefs
harmonizes well with the gray of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
stone. Addresses were made by M.
Armand Gautier and M. Duclaux, who
said that the improved laboratories now
enjoyed by scientific institutions in
Paris were largely due to Pasteur's
efforts.</p>

<p>The minor planet recently discovered
by Witt, remarkable as having an
orbit that comes within that of Mars,
and provisionally known as DQ, has
been named Eros. An examination by
Professor Pickering and Mrs. Fleming
of the Harvard photographs has revealed
traces of this body on twelve
plates taken in 1893 and 1894, and on
four plates of 1896. By the aid of these
plates it has been possible to determine
its elements with greater accuracy than
would otherwise be possible. Its mean
distance from the sun is 1.45810, its
shortest distance 1.13334, and its greatest
distance 1.78286 that of the earth;
the eccentricity of its orbit is 0.222729,
and its period is 643.10 days. Its
synodical period is such that it has
three oppositions in seven years. The
next opposition will be in the last
months of 1900, and will be a moderately
favorable one for observation.</p>

<p>The courses in pure science of the
New York University include undergraduate,
graduate, and summer courses
in mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology,
and biology, with laboratory
privileges and provision for special students
and independent work in chemistry.
The university last year was attended
by 1,717 students in its three
faculties and six schools, and 720 non-matriculant
students and auditors. A
new feature this year is the inauguration
of the Charles F. Deems lectureship
of philosophy, under an endowment of
$15,000 by the American Institute of
Christian Philosophy, with Prof. James
Iverach, D. D., of the Free Church College,
Aberdeen, Scotland, as the first lecturer.
A feature of the university organization
is the institution of a woman's
advisory committee co-operating
with the council. A woman's law class
is supported by the Woman's Legal
Education Society, the purpose of which
is to make business women and women
in private life acquainted with existing
law.</p>

<p>The new Science Building of the
City Library, Springfield, Mass., recently
completed, is being inaugurated by
a Geographical and Geological Exhibition.
It includes the best and latest
maps, models, globes, charts, relief
maps, and photographs, special attention
being paid to the most effective
modes of teaching. One of the most attractive
features of the exhibition is
the work from the Springfield public
schools.</p>

<p>An ingenious method for thawing
out frozen water pipes has been used
by Prof. R. W. Wood, of the University
of Wisconsin. It consists simply of passing
a current of electricity through the
pipe. In one case it is said that one
hundred and fifty feet of frozen pipe was
thawed out in eighteen minutes. The
ordinary street current was used, the
voltage being reduced to about fifty.</p>

<p>In a summary of inspectors' reports
of the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection
and Insurance Company for 1898 it is
stated that of 78,349 boilers, inspected
both internally and externally, during
the year, there were 11,727 dangerous
defects discovered and 603 entire boilers
were declared unsafe for further use.</p>

<p>The recent death list of men known
in science includes the names of Charles
Naudin, an eminent French botanist,

at Antibes, France, March 19th,
aged eighty-four years; Dr. G. W. Leitner,
